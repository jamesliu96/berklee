to Disk</strong></font> 
<p>Recording a performance to disk is only one way of making an audio file. Once 
  we've recorded, edited, and mixed a song in GarageBand or Reason, we'll want 
  to make a mixed stereo file. We can take any of our recorded audio, or MIDI 
  tracks that play back using virtual instruments, and render them to a new audio 
  file in a process called<b> bounce to disk. </b>When we make a new file this 
  way, we'll be taking the mixed and processed audio data from our master output 
  and using it to create a new audio file. </p>

<strong><a name="editing" id="editing"></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Digital 
Audio Editing</font> </strong> 
<p>Once audio data is recorded to disk, we can access any part of a recording 
  instantly. This leads to some ways of editing that are unique to disk-based 
  recording. There are three ways to edit audio once it's stored on disk:</p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Non-destructive</b> 
    editing changes how data stored on disk is played back, without actually changing 
    the original file. </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Destructive</b> 
    editing changes the actual data stored on disk.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Constructive</b> 
    editing writes a new file that saves the changes made in some types of editing. 
    </font></li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this week's class we'll be looking at various ways to edit digital 
  audio that will illustrate non-destructive and destructive editing.</p>
<hr>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="nondestructive" id="nondestructive"></a>Non-destructive 
Editing</strong></font> 
<p>One of the most common types of editing done with audio is rearranging the 
  order of audio events. Much like we do with a word processor, digital editing 
  allows us to copy and paste sections of audio to revise a musical performance. 
  As we'll see, the word processor analogy only goes so far, since the written 
  word and audio recordings are very different types of media.</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of the things we can 
  do with digital audio editing include:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">create different 
    versions, shorter or longer, from an original audio file</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> remove weak 
    sections of a performance and replace them with better versions</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> create loops 
    from sections of a song and use them as the basis for new musical material</font></li>
</ul>
<p>The power of digital editing comes from the ability to define a <b>region. 
  </b>A<b> </b> region has pointers to the beginning and end of a section of a 
  file. Once defined, that section can be accessed at any time. These region definitions 
  can be stored in a file and can be reused whenever, and as many times as we 
  want. Since we're not changing any of the actual audio data in a file, this 
  type of editing is<b> non-destructive.</b> </p>
<p>In GarageBand, we can define and edit regions in the Timeline. Editing audio 
  regions in GarageBand is exactly the same process as MIDI regions. We can shorten 
  or extend, separate, and repeat regions. As with MIDI regions, we can choose 
  to have audio regions move freely or snap to a bars and beats grid.</p>
<hr>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="destructive" id="destructive"></a>Destructive 
Editing</strong></font> 
<p>Although the word "destructive" may sound ominous to you, all it really means 
  when it comes to digital editing is that you're rewriting a file. Although non-destructive 
  editing techniques are very powerful tools for manipulating musical ideas, there 
  are some situations where we are better served by saving our edits as part of 
  a file.</p>
<p>A file that's going to be used as a master for any kind of distribution should 
  be a final, completed version. Most of the non-destructive edits we make need 
  to be played in the software that created them in order to be heard. The regions 
  we define in a GarageBand audio track won't be recognized by a CD or MP3 player, 
  they need to be saved as an audio file in iTunes. If we want to edit them further, 
  we'll use destructive editing techniques. In addition, we can process an audio 
  file to permanently change its fundamental characteristics.</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are some of the ways you'll use destructive editing and 
  processing techniques:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">editing the form or a song</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">eliminating unused portions of a file to conserve storage 
    space</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">changing the level of a recording</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">changing the pitch, length or direction of a the sound</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">preparing audio files to be used in a sampler</font></li>
</ul>
<p>Far from being "destructive" in the usual sense, these types of edits offer 
  a number of creative possibilities to reinvent the sounds we use in a desktop 
  production. </p>

<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="Audacity"></a>Editing 
in Audacity</strong></font> 
<p>Audacity is a free, open source audio editor for OSX. We can use it to complete 
  some basic exercises in audio editing.</p>
<p>We can edit a song form using standard Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, and Trim commands. 
  Cut, paste, delete, and trim functions will change the length of a file. To 
  remove audio without changing the length of a file, use the Silence command.</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The commands found 
  in the <strong><em>Effect</em></strong> menu allow us to process the audio data. 
  Using these, we can perform the following functions:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Change amplitude</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Change pitch</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reverse</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fade in or out</font></li>
</ul>
<p><em>We'll be looking at ways to process audio in real time in Week 11 when 
  we discuss signal processing. </em></p>

<font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name="Loops" id="Loops"></a></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Audio 
Loops </font></strong></font> 
<p>Audio loops are recordings that are edited to fit exactly into a musical meter. 
  Any audio editing program can be used to define loops from a source and save 
  them as separate files. Typical loop lengths are usually groups of &quot;duple&quot; 
  phrases -2 bars, 4 bars, 8 bars. Longer phrases will have more variation, although 
  the tempo of a human performance might shift. A good loop strikes a balance 
  between the two. </p>
<h4><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>A Word About 
  Loops</em></font></h4>
<p>One of the very first digital audio tools available to musicians was a sampler. 
  Although the original intent was to make new types of synthesizer sounds based 
  on audio recordings, a number of enterprising producers began sampling short 
  rhythmic sections of existing songs. These were often drum breaks -sections 
  of a song where only the drums were playing. Using the looping functions found 
  on any sampler, these break beats, as they're called, can be repeated and used 
  as the rhythmic basis for new songs. </p>
<p>Needless to say, this use of copyrighted material has raised numerous legal 
  issues and has stirred an ongoing debate on intellectual property. What constitutes 
  fair use of copyrighted material? If you use two measures of a James Brown recording 
  and create a new song from it, what do you owe James Brown? In response to these 
  legal challenges, a cottage industry of soundware developers has sprung up, 
  providing musicians with libraries of breakbeats, instrumental performances, 
  and virtually any sound you can imagine, all cleared for use in a variety of 
  productions. You'll find examples of these as DrREX loops in Reason or Apple 
  Loops in GarageBand.</p>
<p>The main advantage of using these types of loops in a production is that it 
  allows you, the producer, to incorporate a wide variety performances that you 
  ordinarily might not have access to in your song. Many of these are high-quality 
  recordings, done in a professional studio with well-known pro players. Although 
  the subtlety and variation that comes with a great live performance can't really 
  be captured in a few short sample loops, creative use of these tools can definitely 
  boost the production values of your work.</p>

<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="Loops2" id="Loops2"></a>Working 
with Loops </strong></font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two ways 
  to work with audio loops:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Set the sequence 
    tempo to the loop audio tempo</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Match the loop 
    tempo to the sequence tempo</font> 
    <ul>
      <li><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Time 
        Compress/Expand</font></strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        - Every DAW has some sort of DSP function (some better than others) that 
        will time-compress or expand a loop to match sequence tempo. This method 
        is most effective with tempo changes within + or - 10 BPM since processing 
        will always introduce some audio artifacts.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Beat 
        Slicing</strong> - Drum and percussion loops usually have clear transients 
        that define individual attacks. An audio file can often be split into 
        individual sections or &quot;slices&quot; for each attack. Once all the 
        attacks are separate events, they will act like MIDI events and will follow 
        tempo changes.</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Rex Files</strong></font></p>
<p>DrRex is a loop player in Reason that plays back REX audio files. These files 
  are created with a program called ReCycle, which is a tool for analyzing transients 
  and saving the result in a single stereo REX file. Since slices played at a 
  slower tempo will result in audible gaps, ReCycle can generate additional audio 
  at the end of each slice that serves as a kind of padding. Again, as with time-compression/expansion, 
  there are limits to this. A 2-bar loop at 135BPM will have prominent gaps when 
  played back at a slower 72 BPM.</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>A REX file 
  stores: </em></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Audio as individual 
    slices</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Source tempo 
    information</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Apple Loops</strong></font></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/loops.html" target="_blank">Apple 
  Loop</a> file format is similar to a REX. However, in addition to defining audio 
  as individual slices, pitched musical parts can be recognized by key. In a program 
  like GarageBand, this information can be used to transpose audio performances 
  that have been saved as Apple Loops. </p>
