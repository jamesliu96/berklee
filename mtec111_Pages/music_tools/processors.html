<hr>
<p class="body"><span class="body">As part of a live performance or in mixing, 
  audio may be altered in both subtle and significant ways. Using <b>Digital Signal 
  Processing</b> <b>(DSP)</b> tools, we may add acoustical effects such as <b>reverb, 
  echo, </b>and<b> chorus. </b>We can change the tone color of a sound, or perform 
  very significant changes in pitch or audio quality of a given sound. </span></p>
<p class="body"><span class="body">In the physical world, there are many varieties 
  of effects processors. Today, all of these are emulated in the virtual domain 
  by software-based processors. These are often included in software applications 
  in the form of add-ons called <b>plug-ins</b>. Plug-ins are small files that 
  add functionality to a host application.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span class="body">There are several standards for software DSP 
  plug-ins, including the cross-platform <b>VST (Virtual Studio Technology) </b> 
  format developed by Steinberg and <b>TDM (Time-Domain Multiplexing) </b> developed 
  by Digidesign. </span></p>
<p class="body"><span class="body">For this course, we will be using the processors 
  in Reason. These are emulations of phsical devices that are &quot;built into 
  the rack.&quot;</span></p>

<h4><span class="topic_header"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Effects 
  Processors </strong></font></span> </h4>
<p class="body">In music production we'll often want to change the sound of a 
  recorded performance either to make up for deficiencies in the recording process, 
  or to creatively enhance our tracks in some way. </p>
<p class="body">In the physical world, effects devices come in all shapes and 
  sizes, varying greatly in quality and price. <a href="1_3_1d.html" target="_blank">The 
  examples we've seen so far in this lesson</a> have all been high-end professional 
  devices, but there are many cost-effective units on the market today that are 
  geared toward desktop production. It's also important to remember that every 
  processor has it's own unique sound, and that some of the sounds you may have 
  heard on hit records have come from unorthodox techniques such as processing 
  drums sounds through cheap guitar effects pedals.</p>
<p class="body">Let's take a look at how this plays out in the virtual world.</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Hardware Model</font></h4>
<p class="body">The effects processors we'll use in Reason are modeled after similar 
  hardware devices from the physical world, with some occasional twists. In Reason's 
  virtual studio environment, we'll connect them in much the same way as we would 
  if we were wiring a physical studio. This will make it easy to apply what we've 
  learned in this course to other similar devices. </p>
<p class="body">Much like synthesizers though, effects processors are subject 
  to user interface issues. The best devices not only sound great, but are easy 
  to use. In some effects, this is not so much of an issue, simply because there 
  are can be far less parameters to be edited than on a synthesizer. </p>
<p class="body">RV-7000 is the reverb effect in Reason. On the front panel we 
  see a few basic controls, similar to what we might see on a low-cost hardware 
  device. </p>
<p align="center" class="body"><img src="assets/Reasonverb.jpg" width="753" height="71"></p>
<p align="center" class="body"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reason's 
  REV-7000</font></p>
<hr>
<h4 class="body"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plug-ins</font></h4>
<p class="body">Another approach to effects processing in the virtual world is 
  the use of software plug-ins, as you'll see when when using Digital Performer, 
  Logic or ProTools. Plug-ins are software products that add functionality to 
  a host application. There are many different formats of plug-ins on both the 
  Mac and PC, and the incompatibility of these can sometimes make purchasing plug-ins 
  confusing. </p>
<p class="body">TrueVerb, as we see below, is a reverb plug-in that is available 
  for all plug-in formats. Like software synthesizers, effects plug-ins are designed 
  to take advantage of a computer's user interface and can display much more information 
  about how the various parameters will affect the sound. Compare TrueVerb to 
  REV-7000 above and you'll clearly see that although the parameters seen in REV-7000 
  are in both, TrueVerb goes much further, providing more control and a visual 
  display.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at some common types of effects found in Reason adapted that 
  we'll use in desktop production. </p>
