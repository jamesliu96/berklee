<p> Although these virtual synthesizer modules will <span class="body">help us 
  to <font color="#000000">create and control sound, we'll still need to stay 
  in the physical world to play them. Any MIDI keyboard controller, including 
  your Oxygen 8, will allow us to control the synthesizers in Reason to record 
  our performances using their MIDI sequencers.</font></span></p>

<p class="topic_header"><span class="body">Synthesizers are devices that produce 
  sound entirely by electronic means. Using a synthesizer, the desktop music producer 
  may control every parameter of the sound, including <b>pitch</b>,<b> timbre,</b> 
  and <b>loudness</b>. </span><span class="body">Since the synthesizer allows 
  for very fine control over musical sound, every part performed can meet the 
  precise musical needs of the production.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span class="body">Key technical issues that differentiate synthesizers 
  from one another include:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="body"><b>Polyphony - </b>the number of notes that may be simultaneously 
    sounded.</li>
  <li class="body"><b>Multitimbral capability</b> - the number of unique instrumental 
    sounds that may be sounded at once.</li>
  <li class="body"><b>Memory</b> - the number of sounds contained in a device's 
    memory. </li>
</ul>
<p class="body"><span class="body">Even more important than these technical specifications, 
  are the instrument's sound quality, its ease of use, and the way it feels to 
  play. These</span><span class="body"> are more difficult to quantify and require 
  the musician to actually experience the instrument to determine if it is right 
  for his production needs.</span></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The User Interface</strong></font></p>
<p>How does a user access all the power and flexibility in a synthesizer? </p>
<p>A synthesizer may have hundreds of individual parameters that determine how 
  the device produces a sound and control operational features. We view and edit 
  those parameters through various displays and physical controls found in a <b>user 
  interface</b>. A good user interface is easy to learn and allows the user quick, 
  intuitive control of a synthesizer's many parameters. Although it would be great 
  to have an individual knob or slider for each parameter, hardware is expensive 
  and the sheer number these needed would be cost prohibitive. In the physical 
  world, manufacturers spend a great deal of time and energy designing cost effective 
  user interfaces for their products. </p>
<p>The Triton Rack, pictured below, has a single screen that can display a number 
  of different pages for each group of parameters to be edited. The knobs and 
  buttons we see are multi-functioned and control different parameters, depending 
  on the functions called for in the screen display. This type of paged-based 
  user interface is common to many synthesizers. The downside of this is that 
  in order to take full advantage of all the features available, you're going 
  to spend a great deal of time learning the user interface.</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Editor/Librarians</strong></font></p>
<p class="body">One of the advantages of working in the virtual world is that 
  we're already familiar with the user interface of the computer platform we use. 
  Several software developers have written programs to help musicians easily access 
  all of the programming functions of hardware synthesizers. These editor/librarian 
  programs allow users to edit sounds in a device from their computer screen and 
  store the sounds they've created on their computer. </p>
<p class="body">Take a look at the following screen from EMagic's SoundDiver editor/librarian 
  program. Notice the virtual knobs and sliders, as well as the detailed graphic 
  displays. These provide a clear overview and easy access to all the parameters 
  in this particular hardware synthesizer. </p>

<p class="body"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Virtual 
  Synthesizers</strong></font></p>
<p class="body">Most off-the-shelf computer systems are powerful enough to use 
  their own native processing power to generate synthesized sound. The virtual 
  instruments we'll be using in Reason and Logic produce sound in this manner. 
  Since the user interface of these instruments will be displayed on your computer 
  screen, they'll be great tools to help us learn about synthesizers.</p>
<p class="body">Take a look at Subtractor. Every parameter is shown in a single, 
  easy to read display. There are clearly defined sections that will allow us 
  to quickly edit the elements of sound: pitch, timbre and loudness. </p>
<p class="body">Compare SubTractor to the SoundDiver editor/librarian shown above. 
  Notice that although the user interface looks a bit different, the parameters 
  themselves are very similar. Both display controls for various standard synthesizer 
  parameters, so the concepts we learn using SubTractor can be easily applied 
  to many other synthesizers. </p>

<h4 class="topic_header"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Synthesizers 
  and Samplers</font></h4>
<span class="body">There are a wide variety of synthesizers and samplers available 
in the physical world, most of which are now emulated in the virtual world.</span> 
<p class="topic_header"><span class="body">Synthesizers produce sound in several 
  different ways. Some, like SubTractor pictured above, make their sounds by starting 
  with electronic building blocks, while others begin with short digital recordings 
  of acoustic instruments or sounds from nature called <b>samples</b>. </span></p>
<p class="topic_header"><span class="body">These devices are often called<b> samplers</b> 
  if they can record sounds themselves. If they use prerecorded samples and offer 
  synthesizer control over the sounds they are referred to as <b>sample-based 
  synthesizers. </b>Using the NN-19 Sampler in Reason, we'll learn the basics 
  of using samples to create new sounds. </span></p>
<p class="topic_header">Take a look at Reason's NN-19 Sampler pictured below. 
  You'll notice that although it's a sample-based synthesizer, most of the parameters 
  you'll be editing are the same as what you see pictured in SubTractor. Again, 
  what you learn using NN-19 can be applied to any sampler in the physical or 
  virtual world.</p>
