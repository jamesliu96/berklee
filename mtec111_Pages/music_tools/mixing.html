<span class="body">We use a mixer<b> </b>and effects devices to combine different 
musical parts into a complete production of our music. </span>
<p class="body"><span class="body">A mixer has a number of channels that accept 
  audio inputs and combines them to produce a stereo output by routing and processing 
  those signals in various ways. Each channel is usually laid out in a strip of 
  controls that is replicated for each physical or virtual input. These controls 
  typically include placement in the stereo image (pan), equalization controls 
  that change the tone coloring of the signal, and effect routing controls.</span></p>
<p><a href="1_3_1e.html" target="_blank">As we've already seen</a>, mixing consoles 
  come in all shapes and sizes, from small 4 channel portable units to full-scale 
  automated digital consoles that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. For most 
  desktop musicians, the mixer is the most important hardware component of the 
  production process<font color="#FF0000">. <font color="#000000">All of our audio 
  devices, instruments, audio recorders and processors will be connected to it, 
  and as we'll see in the next lesson, all the audio signals in our system will 
  be routed though it. It's the central nervous system of desktop production.</font></font></p>
<p class="body">However,technology advances have allowed manufacturers to emulate 
  very expensive mixers at very low cost. With the right digital audio interface 
  for your computer, software-based mixing is truly an affordable option. </p>
<p class="body">Just as with synthesizers and effects, the mixer in Reason is 
  modeled after physical world hardware, in this case a typical mid-size mixer<font color="#000000">. 
  The controls we have for volume panning, EQ and effects are visible on every 
  channel as well and effect sends and returns that we'll use to process signals 
  from the various Reason instruments.</font></p>
