    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are some types 
      of tools commonly used to mix recorded tracks in music production. What 
      you'll notice here is that although mixers all perform the same functions, 
      the flexibility and sound quality can vary greatly. Mixers are generally 
      designed to provide a cost-effective set of features with a specific user 
      in mind. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Large Format 
          Console - </b></font>These mixers generally have inputs for between 
          48 and 96 channels of analog and digital connections, will offer high 
          quality dynamics and EQ processing on each channel, as well as full 
          automation. In the world of major label record production, where producers 
          demand the highest sound quality and most flexibility from a console, 
          a mixing board can easily cost between $50,000 to upwards of $250,000.</p>

          Console - </b></font>Most of the features found in large format consoles 
          are now available in smaller, more cost effective models. These will 
          generally have fewer inputs and won't sound as good, but offer tremendous 
          value to producers working on a budget. Much of the music you hear on 
          TV and the radio is produced in smaller professional studios, often 
          located in a producer's home, and these are great choices for those 
          situations.</p>

          - </b></font>Everyone working with electronic instruments and microphones 
          needs some sort of mixer to combine signals from different audio sources. 
          These mixers will generally have between 8 and 32 channels, EG on each 
          channel and some flexibilty in routing signals to and from the mixer. 
          Typically these types of mixers are analog and offer no automation capabilities. 
          These mixers inexpensive, starting at around $200, and are well suited 
          for home recording and live performance. </p>

          found in a software package. </p>
