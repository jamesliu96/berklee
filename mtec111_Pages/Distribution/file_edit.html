  a Master</font></h3>
		<hr>
If we've taken to time to set up a good mix of a song, the bounced file will generally 
be ready for distribution. <br>
Most of the time we'll need to make a few edits and adjusts to make sure the final 
master sounds as good as possible

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For this tutorial 
  you can use the file created in the Bounce-to Disk tutorial or download this 
  file as a starting point: <a href="Mix_demo2.aif">Mix_demo2.aif</a> (13.7 MB)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Open Audacity 
  and choose <strong>Open</strong> from the File Menu. Open the file Mix_demo2.aif.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. You'll notice 
  that there's some empty space at the beginning and end of the file. Remember 
  that since Reason doesn't have have a count off, you probably left the first 
  couple of measures in your sequence empty. Zoom in on the beginning of the file. 
  Select the blank space; choose <strong>Delete </strong>from the Edit Menu, or 
  simply hit the <strong>Delete</strong> key. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/Trim.gif" width="518" height="300" border="2"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remove 
  any blank space at the beginning of a mix file.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Repeat this 
  at the end of the file. Listen carefully to make sure you're not removing any 
  of the reverb tail.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. We can smooth 
  the very end by selecting the last second of audio and choosing <strong>Fade 
  Out</strong> from the Effect Menu. This the very minimum you'll need to do to 
  make an acceptable master. If you're inclined to do some more processing, continue 
  on. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/fade.gif" width="835" height="465" border="2"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Trim 
  the end of a mix file and add a fade if needed.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's 
  try some equalization and compression on our mix file. As you're experimenting 
  with these functions, remember that the basic sound of the mixed file is already 
  set, and at this point, we're just fine tuning. Be subtle!</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Select the entire 
  file by choosing <strong>Select All</strong> from the Edit Menu (Edit&gt;Select&gt;All). 
  Choose <strong>Equalization</strong> for the Effect Menu. A frequency domain 
  graph appears and you'll be able to use breakpoints to define frequency ranges 
  to boost or cut. Click to the blue line to define where you want a range to 
  begin. Click again to choose an end point. Make additional selections and raise 
  or lower the line to boost or cut. You can listen to how your settings affect 
  the sound by selecting <strong>Preview</strong>. When you've settled on settings 
  that sound good to you, click<strong> OK</strong> and the file will be re-written 
  to incorporate the changes. The window below shows a slight </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">boost 
  in the higher frequencies.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/EQ.gif" width="400" height="148" border="2"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  Equalization Window in Audacity</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. You'll notice 
  that although the overall level of the mix is pretty consistent, there is still 
  a fair amount of dynamic range here. Let's add a touch of compression to make 
  the file sound a bit louder and fuller. Once again, select all, and this time 
  choose <strong>Compressor</strong> from the Effect Menu. We're going to be subtle 
  here and set a relatively high threshold. Try the following settings:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Threshold at 
    -6dB</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ratio 3:1</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Apply Gain after 
    Compression</font></li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/compressor.gif" width="400" height="399" border="2"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  Compressor Window in Audacity</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can hear the 
  effect of this by selecting <strong>Preview</strong>. See what you think, and 
  when you're satisfied with the sound, click <strong>OK </strong>to write the 
  changes to disk. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. Listen to the 
  entire song and make sure everything sounds good to you. Remember, this is the 
  master, so take the time to make sure it's done well.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. When we save 
  a file in Audacity, it saves as it's own format, so when you're done, select<strong> 
  Export as AIFF</strong> from the File Menu. Although there's an option here 
  to save as an MP3, it doesn't function in the version we've downloaded, so we'll 
  use iTunes.</font></p>
