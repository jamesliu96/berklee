<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Encoding&#151;The Art of 
  Compression</font></h4>
<p>File compression involves encoding the data in such a way that it can be decoded later, restoring the original data. This is called &quot;lossless compression.&quot; Examples of this are Stuffit or Zip files. These files are first compressed, then decompressed, and the resulting file is unchanged. This is good for distributing files when you want the original data to be preserved. Typical size reductions can be 50-60% of the original. Unfortunately, 50% of a 30MB file is 15MB, still too large for Internet distribution. Plus, these files require special applications to decompress the data, and this compression and decompression takes time, and would not be well-suited for real-time music playback .</p>
		
<p>Data reduction involves encoding the music in a way that takes less storage, by leaving out &quot;less important&quot; information. This type of file size reduction is known as &quot;lossy compression,&quot; because actual information is lost and cannot be retrieved again. However, this kind of data reduction can yield files that are one-tenth the size of the original! Now that three-minute song might take less than 3MB of space&#151;much more manageable. The more data reduction, the smaller the file, but also the less fidelity to the original sound. Most data reduction schemes use a software compression and decompression scheme, known as a CODEC (for <b>CO</b>mpression/<b>DEC</b>ompression) that 
  is asymmetrical&#151;that is, it takes more time to encode the file than it 
  does to decode. This makes it easier to play back the music in real-time.</p>
		
<p>The most common form of music file data reduction used today on the Internet 
  is MP3, a CODEC that allows for files that are one-tenth the size of the original, 
  but still sound fairly good. There are actually newer schemes that provide even 
  greater file reduction with better audio quality, such as the QDesign Music, 
  AAC and Ogg Vorbis CODECs. However, the wide acceptance of MP3 makes it ubiquitous 
  on the Web, so we will focus our attention there. </p>
