		<hr>
<p>Recording a performance to disk is only one way of making an audio file. We 
  can take any of our recorded tracks or MIDI tracks that play back using virtual 
  instruments and render them to a new audio file in a process called<b> bounce 
  to disk. </b>When we make a new file this way, we'll be taking the mixed and 
  processed audio data from our master output and use it to create a new audio 
  file. This will include all audio tracks, audio instrument tracks, and any channel 
  insert plug-ins we've used, as well as any of the audio busses we've routed 
  to our main mix outputs. </p>
<p>Once we've recorded, edited, and mixed a song in an application like Reason, 
  we'll want to make a mixed stereo file. In a multi-track, tape-based system, 
  we'll typically record the main mix outputs of a mixing board to a stereo record 
  deck, often a DAT recorder. We could do this with a hard-disk system as well. 
  However, since we'll ultimately need an audio file to distribute our song as 
  either a CD or an MP3, the bounce to disk function is the easiest way to accomplish 
  this.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Download and 
  open the file <a href="Mix_demo2.rsb.sit">Mix_demo2.rsb</a>. This is the same 
  tune we used to demonstrate mix basics. Feel free to use any other Reason song 
  that you're working on. Play the file and you'll hear a good, basic mix.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Before we bounce to disk, 
  we'll need to set the song's end time in the Reason Sequence window. This determines 
  how long the bounced file will be. If you're using reverb or delay, as we are 
  in this example, make sure to leave an extra measure or two at the end to allow 
  the sound to completely decay. We'll use Audacity to trim the beginning and 
  end of the file.</font></p>

  the file and choose a file format. For our purposes, we can use either Audio 
  AIF or WAVE. Remember though, if the file is going to be played on a PC at some 
  point, you'll want to save it as a .WAV, since that's the native PC audio file 
  format. In either case, choose <strong>Add Extension to File Name</strong>.
