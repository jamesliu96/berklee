<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="top"></a>An Overview 
  of Mastering</font></h3>
<p>Mastering is the first step in the process of manufacturing an audio product for distribution. Traditionally this has meant creating the &quot;master&quot; from which copies are made. In the days of vinyl LPs this meant creating the original lacquer disk used by a mechanical stamper that pressed the disks from soft vinyl. Originally, this process involved a simple transfer from audio tape to vinyl disk, but as equipment and engineers became more sophisticated, mastering became part of the creative process where the final &quot;sound&quot; of the record was crafted. With CDs, mastering is the process of preparing the final file used to make the glass master used in replication. Although at the high end, specialized digital tape and file formats are used, a properly formatted CDR can serve as a replication master.</p>
		
<p>As this process has matured, mastering has become an art unto itself with engineers 
  adding the critical final touches to all material commercially released on CD 
  and the Internet. Although at this point you're probably not quite ready to 
  master your first full-length CD release, understanding some of the basic ideas 
  behind mastering will help give a more polished, professional sound to your 
  desktop productions.</p>
