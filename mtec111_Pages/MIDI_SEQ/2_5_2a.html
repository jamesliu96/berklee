  Command Structure</font></h3>
<hr>
<p>Much as English words are divided into nouns, verbs, and the like, MIDI words
(bytes) can be classified into groups called status bytes and data bytes. A
status byte indicates action and data bytes describe that action. Let us say
for example that we are trying to communicate the fact that we played middle
"C" on the keyboard at a mezzo forte dynamic level. The MIDI translation (as binary code) would be as follows:</p>
<p>10010000  00111100  01000000</p>
<p>You can see that this musical action was described in a
three-word sentence. The first word, 10010000, is a status byte that indicates
the action &quot;note on&quot;. The following two words are data bytes that
further describe the note on action. The second word, 00111100 translates into
the number of the key that was depressed. The range of possibilities is 0-127,
where middle &quot;C&quot; is key number 60. If you translate the binary number
00111100 into a decimal number you will see that it in fact is the number 60,
middle &quot;C&quot;. The final word, 01000000, refers to the velocity with
which the key was depressed, and which most synthesizers translate into
dynamics. The range here again is 0-127. 01000000 translates into a decimal
value of 64 or about mid way between the extreme ranges, hence the relative
dynamic level of <i>mf</i></p>

			<p>This sentence only describes the note-on action, it doesn't specify the duration or
the end of the note. That is expressed as another sentence, a
&quot;note-off&quot; command. Duration then is simply the clock time
(real-time) between the note-on and note-off events. </p>
			
  <h4><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MIDI MESSAGE TYPES</font></b></h4>
			<p>Each musical action has its own status byte and predetermined number of data bytes,
according to the syntax of the MIDI language. So far we have seen the simplest
of MIDI commands, those that turn notes on and off. MIDI commands may be broken
down into two major groups; Channel Messages and System Messages.</p>
