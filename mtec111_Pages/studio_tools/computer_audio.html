  Audio Connections</font></h3>
		<hr>
<p class="topic_header"><span class="body">Audio production tools and their connections 
  have been with us for some time and have been the standards in commercial music 
  production. For us, the computer is the central tool that we'll be using in 
  desktop productions. Many of the many tasks traditionally performed in the physical 
  world are now done on the desktop. </span></p>
		
<p class="body">As an audio tool,your computer performs three main functions:</p>
		<ul>
  <li><span class="subtopic_header"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Analog 
    to Digital / Digital to Analog Conversion (A to D and D to A conversion)</font></b></span> 
    <span class="body">Like any other digital recording device, the computer needs 
    to digitize incoming analog audio signals, and convert them back to analog 
    for playback and monitoring. These are typical record/playback functions.</span></li>
  <li><span class="subtopic_header"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Random Access Storage</font></b></span> 
    <span class="body">One of the big advantages of using the hard disk storage 
    commonly found in all computer systems over tape-based digital recording is 
    the ability to access any recorded sound on our computer at any time. </span></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="subtopic_header"><b>DSP 
    Functions</b></span></font> <span class="body">Once audio data is stored on 
    a computer, processing it is a matter of mathematics. All mixing functions 
    as well as effects processing done in the virtual world are the result of 
    calculations called <b>DSP (Digital Signal Processing)</b> functions. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="body"><span class="body">Since storage and DSP functions are often handled by a host computer's hard disk and CPU, the only configuration options we need to think about have to do with A to D and D to A conversion.</span></p>
		<hr>
		
<h4 class="topic_header"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Computer 
  Input /Output</font></h4>
		<p class="body"><span class="body">.Lets take a look at some of the ways we get sound in and out of a computer.</span></p>
		
<p class="body"><span class="subtopic_header"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Internal 
  I/O</font></b></span></p>
		<p class="body"><span class="body">Most computers now have the ability to record and playback sound. Since manufacturers think of computers as general-purpose devices the quality of the actual AD and DA converters is consumer grade at best. Computers typically use consumer type 1/8&quot; TRS miniplug or pairs of RCA jacks as the connections for stereo input and output. These inputs are often able to accept mic level inputs and will usually output enough power to drive a small set of speakers or headphones. </span></p>
		
<p class="body"><span class="subtopic_header"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SoundCard I/O</font></b></span></p>
		<p class="body"><span class="body">Although the audio functions found on any recent, off-the-shelf computer will be sufficient to get you through this course, many desktop musicians find the features in a 3rd party, add-on sound card to be essential.</span></p>
		<p class="body"><span class="body">These cards are usually easy to install and use the industry standard PCI slots found in most desktop, tower computer configurations. As a rule, these cards use a better grade of AD and DA converters, and will usually sound better. They will also usually offer stereo digital inputs and outputs, typically S/PDIF or TOSLink and in some cases, AES/EBU</span></p>
		<p class="body"><span class="body">Analog connectivity is usually enhanced as a dedicated soundcards will offer a range of options such as RCA, 1/4&quot; and in some cases balanced XLR. </span></p>

		</div>
		<p class="body"><span class="body">Unlike the variety of levels that can be accommodated in a typical home computer, sound cards will usually only handle line level signals and are designed to be integrated into a larger desktop <font color="#000000">production system.</font></span></p>
		<hr>
<span class="topic_header"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Breakout 
Boxes </strong></font></span> 
<p class="body"><span class="body">The inside of a computer case, where the audio circuitry used in either internal or soundcard I/O functions are located, is the devil's playground for a variety electro-magnetic sources of audio interference. </span></p>
		<p class="body"><span class="body">Although manufacturers work hard to design systems that isolate audio components from noise, most professional, computer-based digital audio systems isolate the audio functions of I/O and AD/DA conversion in a separate box, outside of the computer.</span></p>
		
<p class="body"><span class="body">In addition, these systems offer both multi-channel 
  analog and digital I/O in a variety of formats making them very easy to integrate 
  into larger project studios. Although</span><span class="body"> previously only 
  found in expensive, professional systems, there are now many options for connecting 
  breakout boxes to a computer. </span></p>
		
<blockquote> <span class="subtopic_header"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PCI 
  card connection.</font></b> </span> <span class="body">PCI slots are a computer 
  standard for adding hardware functionality or additional processing power to 
  existing desktop systems. The cable that connects the breakout box to the PCI 
  card is usually proprietary and only available through the manufacturer.</span>

  <p><span class="subtopic_header"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">USB.</font></b></span> 
    <span class="body">The Universal Serial Bus is an industry standard for connecting 
    a wide range of standard computer peripherals. Although we don't usually think 
    of serial data transfer as found in an Internet connection to be fast enough 
    to support real-time audio, USB has sufficient bandwidth to reliably support 
    limited digital audio I/O and makes a good choice to connect an entry level 
    breakout box.</span></p>

  <p><span class="subtopic_header"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Firewire</font></b>.</span> 
    <span class="body">A much faster connection is available using the industry 
    standard IEEE 1394 (Firewire) interface. Using Firewire, we're able to reliably 
    support multichannel I/O from an external device using this industry standard 
    connection. </span></p>

		</div>
		<p class="body">Both USB and Firewire use industry standard connectors available in any computer store and enable a wide variety of digital audio interfaces to be used with a laptop computer. This allows musicians to take their virtual studios almost anywhere and is radically redefining what we think of as &quot;the recording studio.&quot;</p>
