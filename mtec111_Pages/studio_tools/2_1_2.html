  Connections</font></h3>

		<p class="topic_header"><span class="body">One of the complicating factors in connecting audio between devices is that there is no single standard for these connections. Instead, connectors come in a variety of sizes and shapes, as well as in two genders-male and female. We should become very consistent in our use of terms when describing audio connectors, and use the following standardized descriptors:</span></p>

        jack on either end and is used to connect various devices. The cable itself 
        may take many forms, with two or more wires, either bundled around one 
        another (coaxially) or next to one another in a sheath. Cables that will 
        exceed a length of 20 feet should be 'balanced,' with special shielding 
        involving a third wire, and will usually have special plugs or jacks with 
        extra pins for the extra wiring.</span></td>
