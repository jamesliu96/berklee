<span class="body">Also complicating matters when connecting devices, are the 
different<b> </b>levels used for various devices.</span>
<p><span class="body">Mixers generally display signal level using <b>VU meters 
  </b>or<b> peak level LEDs</b>. These meters show optimal signal level as<b> 
  0dBu.</b></span></p>
<p>Electronic equipment accepts input signals that are at what we refer to as<b> 
  <em>line level</em>. </b>There are two standards for this. Most consumer or 
  semi-pro electronic instruments are characterized as 'line' or 'instrument' 
  level and generally use unbalanced RCA phono or 1/4&quot; phone connectors. 
  These signals show up at 0dBu on VU meters when the electrical signal level 
  is at<b> -10dBV.</b></p>
<p><span class="body">For most professional studio devices, line level is <b>+4dBV</b>. 
  These connections typically use balanced XLR connectors and show as 0dBu on 
  VU meters when their electrical signal level is at <b>+</b>4dBV. The owner's 
  manual will state the level and plug/jack configurations for all device inputs 
  and outputs. If you need to connect devices with differing signal level requirements, 
  you can purchase specific transformers for going from -10dB to +4dB or vice-versa. 
  </span></p>
<p>Microphone levels are generally in the -40 to -30 dBV range. For this reason, 
  any time you record with a microphone and an audio interface, you'll need to 
  use some sort of preamp that will boost the signal from the microphone to line 
  level. Both the MOTU 828mkII and the Pro Tools M-Box have built-in microphone 
  preamps. </p>
<p><span class="body">One advantage to working in the virtual studio is that until 
  you need to connect your personal computer to a sound system, you never need 
  worry about signal level mismatch.</span></p>
