<p class="body"><span class="body">When connecting two digital devices, the clocks that keep the digital words in precise timing order must be synchronized. </span><span class="subtopic_header">The S/PDIF standard</span><span class="body"> provides for both stereo signals (left and right) as well as the synchronization signal to be carried on a single unidirectional cable. Therefore it generally takes two cables (one each for input and output) to complete a digital audio system. </span></p>
		<p class="body"><span class="body">When using<b> </b>electrical means to connect digital audio devices using S/PDIF, the signals are sent via coaxial cables (two-connectors, one wrapped around the other within the same sheath) and generally use RCA phono connectors.</span></p>

		<p class="body"><span class="subtopic_header">The AES/EBU standard</span><span class="body"> calls for stereo signals to be carried on a single unidirectional cable, using XLR jacks and plugs. This requires two cables, one each for input and output. The synchronization signal may be included or carried on a third, separate coaxial cable, often labeled &quot;Word Clock,&quot; using BNC connectors (shown here).</span></p>

		<p class="body"><span class="body">Multi-Channel digital audio is done either by using multiple pairs of AES/EBU connections, or by using the ADAT or TDIF formats.</span></p>
		<ul>
			
  <li class="body">ADAT (sometimes called &quot;ADAT lightpipe) was developed 
    by Alesis (Alesis Digital Audio Tape) and combines eight channels of audio 
    and the synchronization signal on a single unidirectional optical cable. 
  <li class="body">TDIF was developed by Tascam for transferring audio to and from their MDM (Modular Digital Multitrack) and stands for Tascam Digital InterFace. TDIF uses a 25 pin dSub connector over shielded cabling, and includes both digital audio and synchronization information.
