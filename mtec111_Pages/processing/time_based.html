<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="OV_time"></a>Overview</strong></font></p>
<p>Many of the effects that are most noticeable in modern music production are 
  time-based. These are achieved by mixing a signal with a delayed copy of itself. 
  Unlike dynamics and filter effects, which are often used to enhance recorded 
  sound without being obvious to the listener, we use these to creatively alter 
  the sound of our audio source.</p>
<p>Often, these effects become the sonic signatures of the artists who use them. 
  In the 1980s, Andy Summers of the The Police immortalized the sound of chorused 
  guitar in his work on all of the group's hit records. Longer delays gave David 
  Gilmore of Pink Floyd his characteristic spacious solo guitar sound, while delays 
  timed to the tempo of a song propelled the rhythmic guitar figures characteristic 
  of the Edge's work with U2.</p>

<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="Typical_parameters"></a>Typical 
  Delay Parameters</font></h4>
<p>We can produce a range of effects by delaying a source signal by varying amounts. 
  In order to be heard, the delayed signal needs to be combined with the original, 
  unprocessed signal. The unprocessed signal is often called the &quot;dry&quot; 
  signal and the processed signal is called the &quot;wet&quot; signal. When we 
  use delays as insert effects, we'll always have the option to set the balance 
  between the the two.</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The diagram below 
  illustrates the signal flow in a typical delay processor. </strong></font> </p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Common parameters that 
  we'll adjust in delay effects are:</font></b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Delay time: the amount of time a signal is delayed, usually set in milliseconds 
    (ms)</li>
  <li>Mix: the balance between the processed and unprocessed signal that is output 
    from a device</li>
  <li>Feedback: the number of times a delayed signal will repeat. A minimum value 
    usually indicates one repeat, while a maximum value means an infinite repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a look at DDL-1, the delay unit found in Reason, and see where these parameters 
  are adjusted. You'll notice that in addition to setting delay time in milliseconds, 
  Reason also lets you time discrete delays to the tempo of a song. </p>

  Effects </font></h3>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious delay effect is <b>echo</b>, which refers to discrete 
  repetitions of a sound over time. Even if we've never been near a mountain, 
  we're all probably aware of the effect of yelling &quot;HELLO!&quot; in a canyon 
  and hearing our voice repeat in the distance. This type of delay is one way 
  to give a recorded performance a sense of space.</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Slapback</font></h4>
<p>We'll begin to hear a delayed sound as a distinct repeat at a delay time of 
  around 60ms. As you recall, sound travels about one foot for every millisecond 
  of delay time. A 60ms delay is the amount of time it takes for a sound to travel 
  to and be reflected from a wall 30 feet from the source. This type of very short 
  echo is called <b>slapback, </b>and it's typically used to simulate the sound 
  of a performance in a small, to medium-size empty room. The delay times used 
  to produce slapback usually range from 75 to 125ms, and feedback is set short, 
  so we'll only hear one or two repeats.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="assets/Reflect-30.gif" width="331" height="173"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
  takes 60ms for sound to travel 60 feet to and from a surface</font></p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Echo </font></h4>
<p>We usually think of echo as having longer delay times and multiple repeats. 
  If we continue to think of echo as simulating an acoustic phenomenon, longer 
  delay times usually give the impression of larger spaces. Imagine playing or 
  singing in a sports arena, the typical venue for large touring rock show. A 
  room the size of a football field (100 yards or 300 feet long) will produce 
  600ms echoes. These types of longer delay times, when used subtly in a mix, 
  can help give the illusion of a vocal or soloist performing in a large space.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="assets/Reflect-300.gif" width="331" height="173"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
  takes 300ms for sound to travel 300 feet to and from a surface</font></p>
<hr>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="timed_delays"></a>Timed 
  Delays</font></h4>
<p>One of the problems with longer delay times that anyone who has played in even 
  their high school gym has encountered is that these echoes can often repeat 
  out of time with the musical tempo. Whenever something repeats, it sets up the 
  expectation of a tempo in a listener, and echo is no different. </p>
<p>You'll notice that the Tape Delay plug-in that we'll be using in Logic allows 
  you to set delay time using either milliseconds or tempo. This is a very convenient 
  way to create delays that are timed to the tempo of a song. Although plug-ins 
  that are integrated in desktop audio programs are increasingly making use of 
  this feature, there are many processors, both hardware and software, that won't 
  know about the tempo of your song. Let's do a little math to help us calculate 
  delay times for rhythmic values at any tempo.</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Math</font></h4>
<p> We express musical tempos in beats per minute or <b>BPM. </b>If our tempo 
  is 120BPM, how long is one beat? Since our answer will be expressed in milliseconds, 
  let's think of a minute as 60,000 milliseconds so BPM could be expressed as 
  60,000 divided by tempo.</p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's pull out 
  our calculators!</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What's the duration 
  of a quarter note at 120 BPM?</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">60,000ms / 120 
  = 500ms</font></p>
<p>So, if the tempo of our song is 120 BPM, setting a delay time of 500ms will 
  give us a perfect quarter-note delay. Once we know the duration of a quarter 
  note at any tempo, it's easy to figure out the delay time needed to produce 
  any other rhythmic figure.</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Take a 
  look at the following chart to see how this simple formula can be used to find 
  delay times for rhythmic values at any tempo.</strong></font></p>

  Effects </font></h3>
<p class="body">Rock and pop music production places a high priority on getting 
  a big or larger-than-life sound from instruments such as guitars and vocals. 
  Orchestras and choral groups are traditional examples of more is better when 
  trying to achieve a big sound. If you're working on a big budget CD or soundtrack 
  project, then assembling and recording the required ensemble to achieve a big 
  sound may be possible. However, there are ways to achieve similar effects in 
  the virtual world of desktop production. </p>
<h4 class="body"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Doubling</font></h4>
<p class="body">The easiest way to make an instrumental part sound bigger is to 
  double it by playing in unison with it. One way to achieve this effect is to 
  have a player overdub an exact copy of their part on another track in a process 
  called<b> double-tracking</b>. This demands a tremendous amount of skill from 
  a performer as well as many extra tracks. </p>
<p class="body"> The delay effect of doubling uses a very short delay time that 
  can't be heard as a repetition, somewhere in the range of 20 to 50ms. The idea 
  is to simulate the sound of two instruments playing in unison. Since two musicians 
  will never play at exactly the same time, using a slight delay will simulate 
  this. This electronic way of creating instrumental doubling is very popular 
  when there's only a limited number of tracks for recording.</p>
<h4 class="body"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Modulation 
  Effects</font></h4>
<p class="body"> When musicians play together or double-track, they actually won't 
  play exactly 20 to 50ms later than the original performance. The amount of delay 
  will be changing all the time. To accurately simulate this electronically, we'll 
  need to automatically change delay times. When we use some electronic means 
  to automatically change a parameter in an effects processor or synthesizer, 
  we call it <b>modulation</b>. Most delay devices will use a<b> low frequency 
  oscillator (LFO)</b> to automatically make the delay time slightly longer or 
  shorter. We'll be looking at how an <b>LFO </b>works in greater detail in upcoming 
  lessons on synthesizers. For right now, we can think of it as a tool that will 
  continuously sweep a range of parameters, in our case, delay times. Flanging 
  and chorusing are time-based effects that use an LFO to change delay times. 
  We can think of them as <b>modulation effects.</b></p>
<h4 class="body"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flanging 
  </font></b></h4>
<p class="body">Flanging is produced when a signal is delayed a very short amount 
  of time, on the order of .1 to 15 milliseconds, and is mixed with the dry signal. 
  As these two are combined, multiple bands of frequencies are boosted and cut 
  to produce a characteristic &quot;whooshing&quot; sound called <b>comb filtering</b>. 
  With the LFO changing the delay time, this effect sweeps through the audible 
  range. We can think of flanging as a kind of sophisticated filtering effect 
  that might be simulated by boosting or cutting several bands on a graphic EQ 
  at the same time.</p>
<p class="body">The diagram below illustrates how an audio signal is processed 
  in flanging, as well as some typical parameters we use to control the effect. 
  Compare these to the controls in Logic's Flanger plug-in.</p>

<p class="body">Chorusing is a way of simulating the sound of an ensemble performing 
  musical parts. By increasing the delay time we used in flanging to between 15 
  and 50 milliseconds, we can begin to approximate the timing variations that 
  occur in a group performance. Although this is a way we can create a chorus 
  effect using delay, most chorus effects will process a signal by using an LFO 
  to control subtle changes in pitch. After all, even in the closest unison, performers 
  will still be slightly out of tune with each other.</p>
