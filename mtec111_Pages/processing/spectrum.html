<p>Most of you have seen filters as the Treble and Bass settings on a home stereo, 
as well as more detailed tone controls called graphic equalizers, in a car stereo 
system. In this topic we'll talk about some of the more specialized tools used 
in music production. 
</p><p><font color="#000000">The tools we'll use to process spectrum are called filters. 
  As the name implies, filters are used to allow some frequencies to pass while 
  reducing or eliminating the levels of others. As we'll see, some types of filters 
  allow us to boost as well as cut a given range of frequencies. The range of 
  frequencies affected by a filter is determined by the<b> cutoff frequency</b>. 
  Much like the threshold in a dynamics processor that determines when a signal 
  is affected, the cutoff frequency determines what part of a signal's spectrum 
  will be processed. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We'll be looking at three general categories of filters. 
  As we'll see, different types of filters will have their own sets of controls.

<h3 class="topic_header"><a name="cutoff" id="cutoff"></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cutoff 
  Filters</font></h3>
<p>Cutoff filters are used to remove frequencies above or below a cutoff frequency. 
  Although these are typically found in synthesizers, they are now being being 
  used in music production as well, and are common in many EQ plug-ins.</p>
<p>The cutoff frequency determines when the filter becomes active and is generally 
  the only parameter we can adjust. The frequencies being processed are divided 
  into two ranges, or <b>bands,</b> that will either be removed or allowed to 
  pass. Frequencies that are not affected are part of what we call the <b>pass 
  band </b>since they are allowed to &quot;pass through&quot; the filter unaffected, 
  while frequencies that are removed are part of the <b>stop band</b>. </p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Types of Cutoff Filters</font></h4>
<p>These filters get their names from their pass bands, or the range of frequencies 
  that are unaffected. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A<b> low-pass filter</b> reduces frequencies above the cutoff, allowing 
    those below to pass.</li>
  <li>A <b>high-pass filter</b> reduces frequencies below the cutoff, allowing 
    those above to pass.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be somewhat confusing and may take some getting used to since the 
  range called out in the name is the opposite of the range being reduced.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Low-pass filters reduce higher frequencies.</li>
  <li> Hi-pass filters reduce lower frequencies. </li>
</ul>
<p>Got it! This will become much clearer once we look a some examples.</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Filter Slope</font></h4>
<p>One important thing to remember about filters is that they reduce a range a 
  frequencies gradually. Let's say we've set a low-pass filter to remove frequencies 
  above 1000Hz. This means that the filter will start reducing the level of frequencies 
  at 1000Hz. In the diagrams below you'll notice that the level of frequencies 
  in the stop band are reduced starting just before cutoff, and they are not entirely 
  removed until sometime later.</p>
<p>Since low- and high-pass filters are essential parts of a synthesizer, we'll 
  take a closer look at cutoff filter slope in a future lesson.</p>

<h3 class="topic_header"><a name="shelf" id="shelf"></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shelving 
  Filters</font></h3>
<p>A <b>shelving filter</b> will boost or cut frequencies above or below a cutoff. 
  This adds an additional level of control to the cutoff filters we just looked 
  at by allowing us to either increase or decrease a range of frequencies by varying 
  amounts. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A <b>high-shelf filter</b> boosts or cuts a range of frequencies above a 
    cutoff.</li>
  <li>A<b> low-shelf filter </b>boosts or cuts a range of frequencies below a 
    cutoff.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we said earlier, this type of filter is commonly found in everything from 
  home stereos to guitar amplifiers. One important distinction, though, is that 
  in consumer and musical instrument applications, the cutoff frequency is fixed. 
  We can't change it, and in most cases we don't know where the cutoff frequency 
  is. So, &quot;treble,&quot; although commonly understood to mean &quot;high 
  frequencies,&quot; can actually be anywhere above 5 or 6kHz. Shelving filters 
  used in desktop production will always let you adjust the cutoff frequency. 
  You'll notice from the diagrams below that there's a slope getting to the range 
  of frequencies defined by the cutoff.</p>

<h3 class="topic_header"><a name="parametric" id="parametric"></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parametric 
  EQ </font></h3>
<p>A <b>parametric EQ</b> can boost or cut frequencies in a range both above and 
  below a cutoff frequency. When we listen to the sound of a recorded instrument, 
  there's usually a limited range of frequencies that need to be boosted or cut. 
  Since a parametric EQ allows us to focus on a particular frequency range, it's 
  perhaps the most useful type of filter in desktop production.</p>
<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bandwidth</font></h4>
<p>The range of frequencies around the cutoff that are affected by a parametric 
  EQ is called the bandwidth or &quot;Q&quot; of the filter. This can be adjusted 
  to perform different types of tasks. A narrow &quot;Q&quot; can be used to remove 
  a particular frequency such as the 60Hz hum caused by outside electrical interference 
  in the audio signal. A wider &quot;Q&quot; is used to adjust a general range 
  of frequencies, as might be the case if we wanted to clarify a recording that 
  sounder muddy or muffled.</p>
<p>The parametric EQ is, in a sense, the next step on the evolutionary scale of 
  filters we've looked at so far. As a review, let's look at a roundup of filter 
  types and the parameters available in each.</p>

<h3 class="topic_header"><a name="graphic" id="graphic"></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Graphic 
  EQ </font></h3>
<p>Most people are familiar with a graphic EQ from their home or car stereo system. 
  A <b>graphic EQ</b> allows us to boost or cut multiple ranges or bands of frequencies. 
  These bands are defined by center cutoff frequencies much like what we saw in 
  a parametric EQ. However, unlike a parametric EQ, the center frequencies and 
  bandwidth in a graphic EQ are fixed and can't be adjusted.</p>
<p>The equalizers we've looked at in this topic are generally more useful for 
  music production since they allow us to focus on a particular range of frequencies 
  in a recorded track. A graphic EQ is a more generalized tool, well-suited to 
  adjusting the overall tonal balance of music being played through a particular 
  set of speakers in a given room. </p>
<p>The following example shows the graphic EQ in Apple's ITunes. This is a 10-band 
  EQ on which the bands are set up to correspond to musical octaves. Notice that 
  the center frequency for each successive band is double that of the previous 
  one. A 10-band EQ will divide the entire range of human hearing into ten octaves. 
  (More on octaves in a later lesson!) This is typical of what you'll find in 
  home and semi-pro applications.</p>
<p>Graphic equalizers are common in all types PA systems. Since the size and shape 
  of a room will make certain frequencies more pronounced, a graphic EQ is useful 
  in compensating for this. By cutting bands of frequencies that resonate in a 
  room, we can balance the sound coming from speakers, so it won't sound boomy 
  or cause feedback. In higher end applications like club and concert sound systems, 
  a graphic EQ will often have 30 bands and is commonly referred to as a 1/3 octave 
  EQ. </p>
<p>Many people use the graphic EQ in their car stereo systems to &quot;crank up&quot; 
  the low end, adding a boomy, thumping ambience to the streets of many urban 
  areas. However, as these music lovers get older, they may find a need to boost 
  the midrange frequencies around 2-4KHz so that they can hear speech clearly 
  above traffic noise!</p>
