<h4 class="body"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overview</font></h4>
<p class="body">In audio production, <b>dynamics</b> means loudness. When we change 
  the level of a track in a mixer, we’re adjusting dynamics. In that sense, basic 
  automation is a kind of dynamics processing. <b>Dynamics processors</b> are 
  specialized kinds of tools that respond automatically to level changes in an 
  audio signal. They’re designed to manipulate the <b>dynamic range</b> of a signal. 
</p>
<h4 class="body"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="OV"></a>Dynamic 
  Range</font> </h4>
<p class="body">Dynamic range is the difference between the loudest and the softest 
  part of a musical performance or signal. Although musicians and composers use 
  dynamics as a basic expressive element in music, this sometimes presents challenges 
  in making a good recording.</p>
<p class="body"> Let’s consider the following example: It’s a fine, sunny day 
  and you’re taking a spin in your convertible. A Beethoven symphony is in your 
  CD player. How well does classical music work as driving music? </p>
<p class="body">Composers of concert music use dynamics to build tension and release 
  in music. In quiet sections of the music, you’ll have to turn up the volume 
  on your car stereo, only to scramble to turn down it down when the entire orchestra 
  kicks in at full volume. You’re using the volume knob on your stereo to control 
  dynamic range. After a few minutes of this, you’ll probably wish there was some 
  way to do this automatically. There is! It’s called a <b>compressor. </b></p>
<p class="body">A good symphonic recording should capture the dynamic range of 
  the performance. Remember that the composer wrote the music to be presented 
  in the listening environment of a concert hall, not a convertible. Most popular 
  music is meant for a variety of listening environments, and as such, dramatic 
  shifts in dynamic range are avoided. </p>

  make better driving music?</p>

<strong><a name="compression" id="compression"></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Compression 
- How it Works</font></strong> 
<p>Compression is used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal. We generally use 
  compression to accomplish one of two goals: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Make the dynamics of a performance more consistent so that all the nuances 
    of a performance can be heard equally well.</li>
  <li>Make the performance louder. Remember that in mixing we only have so much 
    headroom. In order to increase overall loudness, we'll have to reduce the 
    level of the loudest parts of a performance. </li>
</ol>
<p>Take a look at the figure below. It&#146;s a waveform display of a two-measure 
  drum part. You&#146;ll notice that there&#146;s a big difference between the 
  highest and lowest peaks of the waveforms, that there&#146;s a wide dynamic 
  range. Listen to the example file and you&#146;ll hear that the highest peaks 
  represent kick drum and side stick snare sounds that provide accents. The lower 
  peaks show the more delicate brushwork on the snare. </p>

<p align="left">In the figure below we see the same drum track compressed. Notice 
  that the visually the difference between the lowest and highest peaks is less, 
  indicating that the accompanying example file has less dynamic range. The result 
  is that the brushwork is apparently louder in context with the kick and snare. 
  This will help to better define the overall rhythmic feel of the finished mix.

<a name="typical_parameters" id="typical_parameters"></a><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Typical 
Parameters of Dynamics Processors</font> </strong> 
<h4><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Typical Parameters</font></h4>
Take a look at some of the parameters we'll find on dynamics processors. 
<ul>
  <li><b>Threshold: </b>the level at which the device becomes active</li>
  <li><b>Ratio: </b>the ratio between input and output levels</li>
  <li><b> Attack/release times: </b>the time it takes for the signal to be reduced, 
    then restored to its original level</li>
  <li><b>Gain: </b>increases the overall level of a processed signal</li>
</ul>
<p>Although there is some variation between different models of hardware and software 
  devices, these are the basic parameters you'll find on most dynamics processors. 
  Understanding how these work will help you use any of those devices.</p>
<p>When we use a dynamics processor, it will be applied directly in the path of 
  a signal. In a mix, we'll use it as a channel insert effect. </p>
<hr>
<h4><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Threshold and Ratio</font></h4>
<p>A compressor will reduce the level of a signal when it reaches a certain <b>threshold</b>. 
  The threshold parameter on any dynamics processor determines when the device 
  becomes active. </p>
<p>Once a signal has reached the threshold it can be processed in a variety of 
  ways that are largely determined by the <b>ratio</b> setting. The ratio determines 
  by how much a signal level is reduced by the process. A 2:1 ratio means that 
  once a signal goes above the threshold, it's reduced by one-half. In other words, 
  a signal that exceeds the threshold by 2 dB will be reduced by 1 dB. A signal 
  that exceeds the threshold by 8 dB will be reduced by 4 dB. As we set the ratio 
  higher, we get a greater reduction. A 4:1 ratio would work as follows. As a 
  signal that exceeds the threshold by 8 dB, it will be reduced by 6 dB to one-quarter 
  its original level as shown in the diagram below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="assets/compression-ratio2.gif" width="551" height="314"></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amplitude 
  reduction with a 4:1 compression ratio</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Since one of the goals in compression is to make a signal 
  louder, we can amplify the level of the final processed output using a control 
  called <b>make-up gain</b>.</font> </p>
<hr>
<h4><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attack and Release Times</font></h4>
<p>Ideally, dynamics processing should sound natural. We shouldn't be able to 
  notice, especially in acoustic recordings, that the sound is being processed. 
  We might notice some dramatic changes in level that could be distracting if 
  the threshold setting functioned as a switch, turning processing on and off. 
  For this reason, a dynamics processor will usually have settings for the <b>attack 
  time</b> and <b>release time</b>. The attack time determines the amount of time 
  it will take for the effect to become active. The release time determines how 
  long it will take for a signal to be restored to an unaffected state. In general, 
  we'll use shorter attack times if we want to reduce the very start of a sound, 
  such as the percussive hit of a drum. We'll use longer release times if we want 
  to gradually restore a signal to its original level. </p>

<h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="types"></a>Types 
  of Dynamics Processing</font></h4>
<p>There are four different kinds of dynamics processing. The difference between 
  these is in how the basic parameters we've just looked at function. </p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Compression: 
    </b></font>The goal is to reduce the dynamic range of a signal and usually 
    boost the overall output. The ratio is typically set between 2:1 and 4:1, 
    and make-up gain is used to increase the level.</li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Limiting:</b></font><b> 
    </b>The goal is to ensure that a signal doesn't exceed the threshold. The 
    threshold is set slightly below the maximum desired output, and a ratio of 
    20:1 or higher is used. </li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Expansion:</b></font><b> 
    </b>The goal to is to increase the dynamic range of a signal so that quiet 
    signals are reduced and louder signals are boosted. This is a common way to 
    reduce noise in a recording, when a performer isn't playing.</li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Gating:</b></font><b> 
    </b>The goal is to only let signals pass that fall above the threshold, eliminating 
    quieter signals.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<hr>
<strong><a name="limiting" id="limiting"></a><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Limiting</font></strong> 
<p><b>Limiting</b> is a form of dynamics processing that prevents a signal from 
  going past a threshold. We can think of it as extreme compression. We'll take 
  a look at the graphic display in the Logic Compressor to see how this works.</p>
<p>In the compression exercise, we explored some basic ideas behind reducing the 
  dynamic range of a signal.Take a minute to review what we've learned. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Any signal level that goes above the threshold will be reduced.</li>
  <li>The amount that's reduced is determined by a ratio. In compressing our bass 
    track we found that a 4:1 ratio was useful. This means that for every 4 dB 
    the signal crossed the threshold, only 1 dB of level was output. </li>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Uses for Limiting</strong></font> 
<p>Generally, limiting is used when we make audio recordings. As we saw when we 
  discussed digital audio, we need to avoid exceeding a maximum level when recording 
  digitally. A limiter is very useful in preventing unexpected peaks in a signal 
  from going over a threshold and ruining a recording. In addition to software 
  plug-ins that we can use in our virtual channel strip, we'll often find limiters 
  in microphone pre-amps. Many of you have probably used a limiter when using 
  video or MiniDisk recorders.</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<h3 class="topic_header"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="gate"></a>Gating</font></h3>
<p><b>Gating</b> is a type of dynamics processing that prevents signals below 
  a certain level from passing.</p>
<p>We've just seen that the difference between compression and limiting is in 
  how we set the compression ratio. When we gate a signal, we're in a sense limiting 
  a signal. But, instead not allowing a signal to exceed a threshold, a gate will 
  only pass signals that are above the threshold. This is commonly used to eliminate 
  background noise from a track.</p>
<font color="#333333" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Some 
Things to Think About</strong></font> 
<p>Noise gates were developed long before automated mix consoles and hard-disk 
  recording, and were used to clean up analog recordings during mixing. These 
  days, we can solve the kind of problem we just encountered by either automating 
  track mutes and levels, or by editing the file to remove the unwanted sound. 
  In modern production, gates are often used to trigger special effects, like 
  the famous Phil Collins gated snare and tom-tom sounds that defined drums sounds 
  in the 1980s.</p>
<p>In setting up dynamics processors we've seen that different instruments will 
  have their own unique loudness contour, or <b>envelope</b>, that we need to 
  take into consideration when making these settings. What we've learned here 
  will ultimately help us when we start using synthesis tools to make our own 
  electronic instruments.</p>
