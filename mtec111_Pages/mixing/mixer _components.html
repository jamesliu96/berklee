  <p class="body" align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
    fader in Reason's mixer channel</font></p>
			<p class="body">Generally there will be a location marked along the path of the fader that indicates <b>unity gain</b>, that is, where the same electrical level of the input signal is output by the fader.</p>
			
  <p class="body">Typically this will be about 2/3 the way up the fader's range. 
    As the fader is moved below that point, the signal is <b>attenuated </b>(decreased 
    in level), and as it moves above that point, the level is <b>boosted</b> or 
    amplified.</p>

      pan control in a Reason mixer channel</font></p>
    <p class="body">At the center point, the input signal is routed equally to 
      both the right and left outputs. As the pan control is rotated towards the 
      left, the signal will be routed more toward the left output, less to the 
      right output. Likewise as the pan control is rotated towards the right, 
      the signal will be routed more towards the right output and less to the 
      left.</p>

  <h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="mutesolo"></a>Mute 
    and Solo</font></h4>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="body">Above the Pan control are two push-button switches labeled 
      &quot;M&quot; for <b>mute</b> and &quot;S&quot; for <b>Solo.</b></p>
    <p class="body" align="center"><img src="assets/Reason_channel_mutesolo.gif" width="180" height="336"></p>
    <p class="body" align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mute 
      and solo buttons in Reason's mixer channel</font></p>
    <p class="body">Pushing in the mute button will disconnect the signal from 
      the output path, and will keep the sound from being heard. This is useful 
      when comparing a mix with or without a given sound source. The mute feature 
      is often used in final mix-down stages to keep an input channel silent when 
      no signal is present, in case the instrument or the mixer has a steady noise 
      floor that is audible.</p>
    <p class="body">The <b>solo</b> button is used to mute all other signals so 
      that only the selected input source is passed to the output. This is useful 
      when you want to hear only a single source while making adjustments to a 
      sound within a full mix, and repeated presses allow you to hear the isolated 
      sound then in the context of the entire mix.</p>

  <h4><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="EQ"></a>Equalization</font></h4>
  <blockquote> 
    <p class="body">The next step along the signal path is the equalization section, 
      where the of the sound may be modified. The Reason channel strip has only 
      two controls here, for <b>Bass</b> and <b>Treble</b>.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="assets/Reason_channel_EQ.gif" width="180" height="336"></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EQ 
      controls in a Reason mixer channel</font></p>
    <p class="body">These two knobs have a center point where the knob has no 
      effect on the signal. Rotating the Treble knob to the right will boost the 
      high frequency components of the sound, while turning it to the left will 
      attenuate the same frequencies.</p>
    <p class="body">Likewise, rotating the Bass knob to the right will boost the 
      lower frequency components of the sound, and turning it to the left will 
      attenuate the bass frequencies.</p>
    <p><span class="body">Some mixers will have three bands of EQ: low, middle, 
      and high frequencies. Some mixers will also allow you to set the range of 
      these bands that will be affected by the equalization controls in addition 
      to the amount that the frequency range will be boost or cut.</span></p>

    <p class="body">Continuing along the signal path, we come to the <b>auxiliary 
      bus controls</b>.</p>

    <p class="body" align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Four 
      auxiliary returns in Reason's master section</font></p>
    <p class="body">These four controls allow you to route the channel's signal 
      to up to four external devices using the<b> auxiliary bus.</b> A <b>bus</b> 
      is simply <font color="#000000">a pathway that we use to send a signal from 
      one place to another. The control for any bus send determines the amount 
      of signal that is sent to a destination. With the control set to a minimum 
      value, no signal is being sent. The auxiliary send doesn't interrupt the 
      signal path through the channel strip; it's used to divert some of the signal 
      to an external output. As we saw when we configured a Reason studio in Lesson 
      2, an auxiliary bus can be used to send some of the signal in a channel 
      out of the mixer to an external effects processor.</font></p>
    <p class="body">Once a signal has been processed, it's returned to the mix 
      via the <b>Auxiliary Return </b>inputs located in the master section of 
      any mixer. The control on the auxiliary return determines the amount of 
      signal added to the unprocessed, mixed signal being output to a stereo mix 
      deck.<font color="#FF0000"></font></p>

    <p class="body">The auxiliary busses allow signals from multiple channel strips 
      to be routed to the same processing device, such as reverb, and the aux 
      send knob allows each channel to control how much reverb will be added to 
      that individual signal.</p>
    <p class="body">The return controls allow you to set the amount of effect 
      (such as reverb) that is added to the mix. This level is common for all 
      signals going to the reverb.</p>
