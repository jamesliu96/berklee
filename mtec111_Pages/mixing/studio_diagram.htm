record/mixdown session the control room is usually acoustically isolated from 
the recording room. The following signal routing needs to be accomplished:</strong></font>

    a microphone in the recording room needs to be routed to the multitrack record 
    deck. </font>

    multitrack record deck.</font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The performer 
    needs to hear themselves (the output of their microphone) clearly in the headphones.

  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An engineer 
    in the control room needs to monitor playback from the multitrack record deck 
    as well as the performer. </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The output of 
    the multitrack record deck needs to be routed to the mixing board, effects 
    processors and finally to a stereo mixdown deck</font>.
