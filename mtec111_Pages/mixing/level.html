<p><span class="body"> When connecting audio devices, there are the different<b> 
  </b>levels used for various devices.</span></p>
		<p><span class="body">Mixers generally display signal level using <b>VU meters </b>or<b> peak level LEDs</b>. These meters show optimal signal level as<b> 0dBu. </b></span></p>
		<p class="body">Most consumer or semi-pro electronic instruments are characterized as 'line' or 'instrument' level and generally use unbalanced RCA phono or 1/4&quot; phone connectors. Line level signals show up at 0dBu on VU meters when the electrical signal level is at<b> -10dBV.</b></p>
		<p><span class="body">Professional recording devices typically use balanced XLR connectors and show as 0dBu on VU meters when their electrical signal level is <b>+4dBV</b>. The owner's manuals will state the level and plug/jack configurations for all device inputs and outputs. If you need to connect devices with differing signal level requirements, you can purchase specific transformers for going from -10dB to +4dB or vice-versa. </span></p>
		<p>Microphone levels are generally in the -40 to -30 dBV range.</p>
		<p><span class="body">One advantage to working in the virtual studio is that until you need to connect your personal computer to a sound system, you never need worry about signal level mismatch.</span></p>
