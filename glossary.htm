<hr>
<p><b>Active Device - </b>Any electronic signal processing device that
requires AC or DC current to power its operation, and that generally includes
an amplifying stage after its primary processing circuit, allowing the
output level to be matched to the input level. (WW)
<p><b>Additive Synthesis - </b>(A) Randomly chosen amounts and phases of
a fundamental and its
<br>second through sixth harmonics; (B) The complex wave created by combining
the above waveforms. (WW)
<p><b>ADSR</b> - Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release. The four sections of
every sound's envelope. (WW)
<p><b>ALU -</b> Arithmetic and Logic Unit. The portion of a CPU that actually
performs arithmetic and other computational procedures. (WW)
<p><b>Analog-To-Digital Converter (ADC) - </b>In digital recording, the
group of circuits that sample the analog waveform, measure its instantaneous
voltage, and convert this decimal value to its binary equivalent, in preparation
for storage on tape (or on floppy disk, in random access memory, etc.).
(WW)
<p><b>Analog Recording -</b> Any method of recording in which the recorded
waveform is a continuous representation of the original signal. Example:
conventional magnetic recording, direct to disc. (WW)
<p><b>Applications</b> - Any complex software the user buys to accomplish
a repetitive job that is unrelated to the basic nature of his own goals.
A word-processing program is a good example, since it is mathematically
complex, but its internal operations are functionally irrelevant to the
user who is writing letters or a book. (WW)
<p><b>ASCII</b> - American Standard Code For Information Exchange. The
most common code used for transmitting text data from computer to computer,
or to peripherals. The code employs 8-bit binary words, by which each letter
of the English language, each Arabic numeral, and each commonly used symbol
is uniquely designated. (WW)
<p><b>Attenuation -</b> A fixed or variable reduction in signal strength,
which may in turn reduce the volume of sound heard. (WW)
<p><b>Attenuation Pad (or Pad)</b> A resistive network or other circuit
generally passive, that is inserted in an audio line to reduce the signal
level. (WW)
<p><a NAME="Glossary B"></a>
<hr>
<p><b>Balanced Line -</b> An electrical cable with two conductors and a
separate shield. When a signal is present, the conductors have the same
potential with respect to ground, but opposite polarities. (WW)
<p><b>Bandwidth - </b>1. Strictly speaking, the arithmetic difference between
the highest and lowest frequencies that are (a) passed by an electronic
device, or (b) present in a specific acoustic sound or audio signal. Example:
The bandwidth of a telephone is approximately 2.2 kHz-i.e., 2,400 Hz minus
200 Hz. The endpoints of a circuit's or system's bandwidth are those frequencies
at which its response or Output is attenuated by 3 dB.
<p>2. Colloquially, the low and high frequencies of any specific frequency
band. One might say, "The bandwidth of an electric guitar is 80 Hz to 8
kHz." (WW)
<p><b>Bit</b> - The smallest unit of information that can be stored, transmitted,
or processed by any digital circuit - e.g., a computer. Each bit is a "1"
or "0" and corresponds to a single yes/no, on/off, or other similar decision.
Abbreviated from <b>BI</b>nary digi<b>T</b>. (WW)
<p><b>BPM Beats Per Minute</b> - A measurement used by disc jockeys to
determine whether two rock or dance records will blend or mix together
smoothly. BPM ratings are often printed by record companies on the labels
of promotional copies sent to radio stations, record pools, and individual
disc jockeys. (WW)
<p><b>Buffer Memory</b> - In digital circuits, an intermediate storage
device (or memory) that can receive and dispense data at different rates,
or merely hold data until the following device is prepared to accept it.
Often used to adapt the output rate of one device - e.g., a computer-to
the input rate of another e.g., a printer. One use of buffer memories in
digital recording occurs in error correction circuitry, where such a device
holds data read from tape until it can be checked for accuracy, at which
point it is decoded and reproduced. Buffers are also used to resequence
data in de-interleaving, and to reduce wow and flutter in digital playback.
(WW)
<p><b>Byte</b> - A sequence of 8 bits of data, established as a standard
parcel of information in computing because it can designate any of 63 possible
items (2 raised to the 8th power, minus 1). This number is sufficient to
uniquely specify any letter in the English alphabet, any single Arabic
numeral, and a group of commonly used symbols. For that reason, the byte
is used as the basis of the ASCII code. (WW)
<p><a NAME="Glossary C"></a>
<hr>
<p><b>CD-ROM</b> - Compact Disk Read-Only Memory. A data storage format
for compact discs that enables digital sound and or visual materials to
be encoded on the disc. If visuals will accompany audio, the format allows
enough memory for about one still image for each 30 seconds of audio. As
a publishing medium, CD-ROM offers book publishers vast storage capacity.
The <i>Grolier Encyclopedia</i> was the first book available in this format,
the entire printed edition fitting on a single CD. Random access availability
of data and the enormous indexing capacity of CDs make this a great medium
for printed matter. The total storage capacity of a single CD-ROM is about
650 megabytes. (WW)
<p><b>Chip - </b>The miniaturized signal-processing heart of an integrated
circuit, or any of the thumbnail sized data storage or data-processing
circuits in computers, digitally controlled devices, etc. (WW)
<p><b>Chorus -</b> A type of signal processing that slightly delays and,
by rhythmic flanging, doubles the apparent number of players or singers
heard in the signal. Chorusing also adds a vibrato to the resulting signal.
(WW)
<p><b>CPU</b> - Central Processing Unit. The integrated circuit chip in
a computer that actually performs most operations on data. (See ALU) (WW)
<p><b>CRT</b> - Cathode Ray Tube. Either black and white or color. Although
there are all shapes and sizes of CRT's, the most familiar is the picture
tube of every television. (WW)
<p><b>Compression - </b>The squeezing together of air molecules during
the first half of each complete cycle of a sound wave. It corresponds to
the portion of the wave that appears above the axis when graphed. Opposite
of rarefaction. (WW)
<p><b>Compression Ratio -</b> The numerical ratio of the decibel increase
in input level of a compressor (above the threshold) that produces a one
decibel increase in output level. Example: If the increase in input level
is 5 dB for every 1 dB increase in output, the compression ratio is 5:1.
(WW)
<p><b>Compressor - </b>A signal-processing device consisting of an amplifier
whose gain decreases automatically as the input signal level increases
above a specified threshold. Some models use their own output signal to
control gain reduction. The result is a decrease in the dynamic range of
the signal from input to output, primarily by reduction of the level of
transients or peaks in the signal. This can prevent overload on steep transients
and, when the gain prior to compression is greater than unity, provide
a boost for very low level signals. (WW)
<p><b>Condenser (or Capacitor) Microphone - </b>A microphone in which the
vibrating diaphragm is electrically charged and acts as one plate of a
capacitor. The movement of the diaphragm or membrane with respect to a
rigid plate (charged with the opposite polarity) causes a tiny change in
the potential between them. This is amplified by an internal pre-amplifier
and sent to the recording console. DC power is required to run the pre-amplifier.
Works like an electrostatic speaker in reverse. (WW)
<p><b>Crossover Frequency -</b> Loosely, the frequency above and below
which an audio signal is divided into two bands, each of which is directed
to a separate destination. Strictly speaking, the frequency at which each
of these two bands is attenuated 3 dB by the crossover network. (WW)
<p><b>Crossover Network -</b>A circuit or device that divides a broad-band
audio signal into two or more separate bands, each of which can be sent
to separate amplifiers, processors, etc. Used most often in speaker systems
to divide the amplifier s output into two or more bands, directing only
the proper frequency bands to each type of driver. (WW)
<p><b>Cue Mix -</b> The blend of live inputs and/or previously recorded
tracks sent hy the engineer to the headphones of performers playing or
singing in the studio. Also called the headphone mix. (WW)
<p><b>Cue Send - </b>The section of the recording console that controls
the source and volume of the signal to be sent to the cue box. There are
normally cue send volume controls at each module, all of which are mixed
and fed via the cue bus(es) to a master cue send volume control located
in the monitor or master control module. (WW)
<p><a NAME="Glossary D"></a>
<hr>
<p><b>Database - </b>Any large body of information through which the computer
can sort to find subsets of data whose members share one or more user-specified
characteristics. (WW)
<p><b>Decay - </b>1. Used both for acoustical and electronic sound sources.
The characteristic fall-off in output amplitude or volume a sound producing
source emits when the force creating the vibrations (or the current powering
the oscillator in a synthesizer, for instance) is removed. This term is
often confused with release, the fourth section of a sound's envelope.
2. The second of four sections of a sound or signal's envelope. In order,
they are attack, decay, sustain, release. (WW)
<p><b>Decay Rate - </b>The number of decibels per second by which echoes
or reverberation of a sound diminish once the sound has stopped. Depending
on the sound source and environment, the decay rate may be linear (e.g.,
a steady number of dB per second), or it may begin to decay slowly and
then fall off rapidly, or the reverse. In addition, various frequencies
in the sound may decay at different rates. (WW)
<p><b>Decay Time -</b> The length of time it takes for echoes or reverberation
of a sound to diminish 60 dB below its original level, effectively to inaudibility.
More precisely known as reverberation time or T-60. (WW)
<p><b>Decibel (dB) -</b> 1. A unit of level used to designate power ratios
in acoustic and electric measurements, adapted separately for various power
and voltage scales. 2. Loosely, the smallest increment in perceived volume
that the average human ear can detect. In early experiments with sound,
it was noted that 1/10 bel is very close to this increment; thus, precise
measurements of volume are standardized in decibels. (WW)
<p><b>Delay - </b>The time interval between the initial occurrence of a
sound or signal and its repeat or echo. (WW)
<ul><b>Acoustic Delay - </b>A delay line in which a speaker and microphone
are separated by an extended path length, such as by placing them at opposite
ends of a long tube. The delay itself is derived from the time it takes
the sound to travel through the air in the tube.
<p><b>Digital Delay (DDL) - </b>An electronic delay line in which the time
delay is created by translating the analog input signal into digital information,
which is stored for a determined or adjustable length of time, then reconverted
back to an analog signal and sent to the output. Many DDLs allow adjustable
regeneration or feedback, causing multiple repeats, and other effects such
as flanging or chorusing of the input signal. (WW)
<p><b>Tape Delay - </b>A delay produced by recording and playing back a
sound or signal simultaneously on the same recorder, taking advantage of
the time it takes the tape to travel from the record to the playback head.
Also, the tape and recorder with which this is done. Tape delay was used
long before digital and other systems were developed. Because the heads
are stationary, the only way to adjust the delay time is by changing the
tape speed itself. Sometimes called a slapback. (WW)</ul>
<b>Delay Line -</b> Any device-acoustic or electronic-that intentionally
introduces a time delay between its input and output signals. (WW)
<p><b>Diaphragm -</b> The part of a microphone (the membrane) or loudspeaker
(the cone) that moves in response to sound waves or an incoming signal,
respectively. (WW)
<p><b>Digital-To-Analog Converter (DAC) -</b> A group of electronic circuits
that reads and decodes sequential numerical voltage samples, then recreates
a stepped waveform that approximates the analog waveform existing before
initial encoding. The voltage samples may come from any storage medium,
tape, RAM, a buffer memory, etc. (WW)
<p><b>Digital Recording - </b>The original analog waveform is sampled,
yielding a voltage value for each sample. These values are converted to
binary numbers which are encoded on tape as a biphase signal. Upon playback,
the voltage values are reconstructed, then filtered and smoothed. Sampling
at a rate less than the nyquist frequency results in an incorrect replica
of the original waveform. Sampling at or above the nyquist frequency results
in a duplicate of the original waveform. (WW)
<p><b>Direct Box -</b> A device containing an impedance matching transformer
(and sometimes a pre-amplifying circuit) that allows the output of an electric
instrument to feed the input module of a recording console directly. Also
called a D.I. (direct input). (WW)
<p><b>Distortion -</b> Any change in the waveshape of a signal that occurs
between the input and the output of an audio device. Strictly speaking,
equalization and compression are types of distortion, even though they
are used to "enhance" sound or make it more usable. Specific distortion
ratings are expressed in percentages, representing the amount of distortion
present in the total amplitude of the output waveform. (WW)
<p><b>DOS</b> - Disk Operating System (pronounced "doss"). A suffix used
by software and hardware manufacturers to describe the way their products
organize data and package it for storage. Each manufacturer has its own
operating system, although the acronym DOS is often mistakenly taken to
imply that there is one universal system. (WW)
<p><b>Doubling - </b>1. Sometimes mistakenly used to mean tracking, the
recording on multitrack tape of a second performance of an instrumental
or vocal part already recorded once (played or sung by the same performers),
usually done to achieve a fuller sound. 2. Loosely, creating the aural
impression of more players and/or singers than were originally recorded
by mixing a slightly delayed duplicate of their track(s) in with the direct
signal. (WW)
<p><b>Dynamic Microphone -</b> A moving coil or ribbon microphone, in which
the movement of the diaphragm (with its attached coil of very fine wire)
or ribbon through the field of a permanent magnet induces a varying output
voltage. This voltage is sent to the recording console. Works like a dynamic
loudspeaker in reverse. (WW)
<p><b>Dynamic Range -</b> 1. The number of decibels between the levels
of the loudest and softest sounds that can be made by an instrument, or
between the loudest and softest passages in a live or recorded piece. 2.
In a tape recorder, or with respect to a specific type of recording tape,
the decible level difference between its inherent noise level and the signal
level at which 3% total harmonic or third harmonic distortion is present
at the output or on tape. (WW)
<p><b>Dynamic Signal Processor - </b>Any electronic device whose type or
degree of operation changes in response to level or other characteristic
of the input signal-e.g., compressors, noise reduction systems, flangers,
etc. (WW)
<p><a NAME="Glossary E"></a>
<hr>
<p><b>Electret Microphone - </b>A condenser microphone whose diaphragm
and plate are semi-permanently charged during manufacture. The charge can
dissipate after several years, which will cause a loss of output level,
etc. (WW)
<p><b>Envelope - </b>If the amplitude vs. time graph of a musical sound
is plotted, the envelope of the sound is the overall shape of this graph.
More exactly, the curve and its reflection that enclose the waveforms comprising
a sound. A sound's envelope includes its attack, decay, sustain, and release.
(WW)
<p><b>Envelope Generator -</b> A device that produces a control voltage
that varies with time according to the user's specifications. This voltage,
applied to each note played on a synthesizer, gives notes the desired envelope.
Also called a contour generator. (WW)
<p><b>Equalization ("EQ" ) - </b>The process by which one electronically
modifies the frequency response of an audio system, and thereby the relative
frequency content or energy distribution curve of an audio signal passing
through it. (WW)
<ul><b>Composite Equalization - </b>The overall frequency response modification
produced when a signal passes through more than one equalizing circuit
in the
<br>same device, or through several equalizers in series. (WW)
<p><b>Record</b> or <b>Playback</b> <b>Equalization</b> - In tape recording,
the internal and complimentary alteration of the frequency response of
input signals prior to recording and output signals after playback. By
boosting highs prior to record and reducing them after playback, some tape
noise is eliminated. In addition, the equalization curve can compensate
for nonlinear response of the specific type of recording tape in use. The
NAB, C.C.I.R., and I.E.S. established standard record/playback curves used
in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. (WW)
<p><b>Room Equalization - </b>The alteration of the frequency response
of signals that will be sent to speakers or monitors, done in order to
compensate for resonances or other response problems inherent in the room
itself. These problems are generally identified by sending pink noise to
the speakers, then adjusting the frequency response of the resulting sound
that arrives at the listening position. Real-time analysis and other lab
tests are often tempered by human judgment in setting room EQs. (WW)</ul>
<b>Equalizer (EQ) - </b>Any signal processing device used to change the
frequency response, relative frequency content, or spectrum of signals
passing through it. Equalizers are sometimes mistakenly called filters.
Filters may be used in equalizer circuits, but only the passive equalizer
can properly be called a filter, since it can only detract from the input
signal. (WW)
<ul><b>Active Equalizer - </b>An equalizer that employs active electronic
components such as transistors or ICs in its processing circuit(s). A pre-amplifying
circuit generally follows each stage of actual equalization, boosting the
signal level to restore unity gain. If the unit allows overall adjustment
of output level, the engineer can A-B the flat and equalized signal. (WW)
<p><b>Graphic Equalizer - </b>An equalizer whose controls are a set of
sliding pots, usually arranged in a row, and each of which adjusts the
amount of boost or cut in a specified band of the input signal's overall
frequency content. The positions of all the controls gives a "graphic"
representation of the frequency response curve that is applied to any input
signal. (WW)
<p><b>Parametric Equalizer - </b>An equalizer in which the center of the
frequency band that each boost/cut control affects can be continuously
varied over a wide range. The amount of boost or cut for each band is separately
adjustable. Sometimes the bandwidth that each boost/cut control affects
can also be varied by a second control. The bandwidth parameter is often
erroneously called Q. (WW)
<p><b>Passive Equalizer - </b>An equalizer that employs only passive electronic
components�i.e., resistors, capacitors, and/or inductors. Since these components
consume some of the signal internally, passive equalizers can only cut
each operating band. The output signal is thus lower in level than the
input. (WW)
<p><b>Shelving Equalizer - </b>An equalizer that raises or lowers frequencies
beyond its turnover frequency by a fixed and continuous amount. A shelf
boost of 6 dB above 5 kHz will thus increase all frequencies in the signal
above 5 kHz by dB. (WW)</ul>
<b>Equal Loudness Contours - </b>A set of superimposed graphs plotting
the human ear's sensitivity to sound vs. frequency, each graph representing
this phenomenon at a different loudness level. Also called the Fletcher-Munson
curves, after the scientists who derived them. A new version, the Robinson-Dadson
curves, is gaining favor. (WW)
<p><b>Expander -</b> An amplifier whose gain is unity for signals below
a specified threshold, then increases for higher input signal levels, or
(b) is unity for signals above a designated threshold, then decreases for
input signals below that threshold. Most professional units employ the
second design. Noise gates are good examples of the lo-type expander. (WW)
<p><a NAME="Glossary F"></a>
<hr>
<p><b>Fader - </b>An adjustable level or "volume" control, usually linear
in design and operation. Sometimes called a mixer, especially in England
and Europe. Functionally, a potentiometer. (WW)
<p><b>Filter - </b>An equalizer that attenuates designated frequencies
or bands. These bands may be very narrow or quite wide. (WW)
<ul><b>Bandpass Filter - </b>An equalizer that attenuates frequencies above
and below a designated band. A low-pass filter thus allows low frequencies
but not high frequencies to pass through. (WW)
<p><b>Comb Filter</b> - A filter that, through phasing cancellation, notches
out a series of different frequencies in an incoming signal. This is the
principle by which flanging is achieved. (WW)
<p><b>Cut-Off Filter</b> - An equalizer that sharply attenuates all frequencies
that are above or below a designated limit. (WW)
<p><b>Dynamic Filter</b> -An equalizer whose operating bandwidth changes
automatically in response to changes in program level, frequency content,
or some other parameter. (WW)
<p><b>Low Frequency (or High-Frequency) Shelving</b> - An equalizer that
attenuates frequencies uniformly below or above the designated turnover
frequency, respectively. (WW)
<p><b>Notch Filter</b> - A filter that severely attenuates a very narrow
band of frequencies. Often used to eliminate steep resonances in an instruments'
response, or to get rid of motor hums, feedback, room resonances, and other
unwanted sounds that may have been present when a signal was recorded.
(WW)</ul>
<b>Flanging - </b>The characteristic sound created by mixing a direct signal
with the same signal, slightly delayed by a continuously varying amount
of time. As the delay time varies, certain frequencies in the signal are
reinforced or completely phased out. These frequencies travel up or down
throughout the entire spectrum as the delay time varies, "combing" the
spectrum. Originally discovered when playing two copies of the same tape
synchronized on separate decks, then manually applying drag to the flanges
of one tape reel or the other so that a small delay is introduced between
the two identical programs. Flanging is one of a number of effects called
"comb filters." (WW)
<p><b>Fletcher-Munson Curves -</b> Equal loudness contours, which show
the volume (or SPL in decibels) of a sound the ear perceives as being of
equal loudness as the frequency of the sound increases for 20 Hz to 20
kHz. Since the ear is most sensitive at around 3 kHz, it takes a much higher
volume of tones at low and high frequencies before the ear perceives them
as being "equal" in volume to a 3 kHz tone. (WW)
<p><b>Floppy Disk - </b>A thin, flexible disk coated with magnetic oxide,
and used as a permanent medium for data and/or programs. (WW)
<p><a NAME="Flutter"></a>
<p><b>FM Synthesis - </b>A process of signal production in which the frequency
of a carrier wave is modulated by the amplitude of an audio signal, in
turn generated in response to control voltages from a keyboard, etc. (WW)
<p><b>Format -</b> To designate the parameters that control how and where
a computer stores data on a floppy disk or other so-called hard memory.
Formatting parameters include the types of data, data density on the disk,
size of any matrices, how data is grouped for easy retrieval, etc. Compatibility
among computers often depends on their formatting, rather than internal
operation. (WW)
<p><b>Frequency</b> - Concerning any acoustic sound wave or cyclically
varying electric signal, the number of complete vibrations or cycles per
unit. (WW)
<p><b>Frequency Response - </b>1. A graph of the amplitude vs. frequency,
either for an acoustic sound or for a signal passing through any piece
of audio equipment.
<p>2. The graph that shows an audio device's output amplitude through a
wide frequency band, when the amplitude of the input through that band
is constant. So-called "flat" response indicates a horizontal, straight
line response "curve" (as it is often called), which in turn means that
the device passes all frequencies equally well, or without coloration.
(WW)
<p><b>Fundamental</b> - The frequency of the first in a series of partials
which make up the timbre of a musical sound. This <i>first partial </i>will
also have the highest amplitude in the series and will be the frequency
we recognize as the pitch of the musical sound. eg.: The fundamental of
a complex musical waveshape at A440 will be 440Hz.
<p><b>Fundamental</b> - The primary frequency, or lowest frequency, present
in a sound source or musical note. Frequencies caused by beating between
two notes or sound sources, but that are not inherent in either source,
are not fundamentals. (WW)
<p><a NAME="Glossary G"></a>
<hr>
<p><b>Gain -</b> The ratio of the signal level at the output of an audio
device to the signal level at its input. Normally expressed in decibels
(dB), but sometimes as a ratio of voltages. Unity gain, for instance, denotes
identical input and output levels. A gain of 6 dB indicates that a device
amplifies signals by 6 dB, equivalent to a doubling of the signals' voltage.<b>
</b>The voltage ratio here is thus 2:1. (WW)
<p><b>Gate -</b> 1. A control voltage generated by any key on a synthesizer
keyboard that instructs signal generators and other devices to begin operating.
2. Short for noise gate. (WW)
<br><b>Ground -</b> An electrical pathway or conductor connected to the
earth, or a conductive object so large that its potential is considered
zero. (WW)
<p><b>Ground Lift -</b> 1. Generally, a three prong AC plug adapter used
without its ground connected in an attempt to eliminate the occurrence
of a ground loop through the power cord of a piece of equipment. 2. On
a D.I. box, the switch that disconnects the common ground between its input
and output. Used to help eliminate hums and buzzes in the signal, caused
by improper grounding of some instrument pickups, or by the effect of RF
fields on magnetic pickups, etc. (WW)
<p><b>Ground Loop -</b> An electronic problem caused if the common return
wire of a system has two or more connections to ground. The resulting closed
path or "loop" is susceptible to electromagnetic induction from AC fields,
resulting in hum or RF pickup by the system. (WW)
<p><a NAME="Glossary H"></a>
<hr>
<p><b>Hard Disk - </b>A data storage and retrieval device consisting of
a disk drive and one or more permanently installed, precisely machined
rigid disks. (WW)
<p><b>Harmonic</b> - An integer multiple of the fundamental frequency of
a sound. The first harmonic (also called a "partial") is the fundamental
itself the second harmonic is two times the fundamental, etc. (WW)
<p><b>Hertz</b> - Abbreviated Hz. Formerly called cycles per second. The
time by which frequency is measured and specified. (WW)
<p><b>Hexadecimal</b> - In the hexadecimal numbering system, any of the
sixteen symbols (the arabic numerals 0 through 9 and capital letters A
through F) can be used to express numbers 0 through 15. (WW)
<p><b>Hum - </b>A low-frequency unwanted noise of definite pitch - generally
60 Hz or multiples thereof - that usually imposes itself on a signal through
the effect of stray magnetic fields, the proximity of AC lines, or through
improper grounding. (WW)
<p><a NAME="Glossary I"></a>
<hr>
<p><b>Input - </b>1. The connector by which a signal enters an electronic
device, or the signal itself. 2. An electronic operating mode in tape recorders,
in which the input signal to various tracks are routed directly to their
outputs. (WW)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Glossary K"></a>
<hr>

pressure. A potentially misleading term unless the context of its usage
is well defined. (WW)
<p><b>LFO- </b>Low-Frequency Oscillator. A circuit whose output is generally
used to control some parameter of another signal-generating or signal-processing
device. LFO output, when applied to audio signal level, produces a tremolo.

in a paint-like binder and coated onto continuous plastic or other film
base. When passed by an electromagnet through which an audio signal flows,
the particles are magnetized in proportion to the instantaneous level of
the signal. This linear magnetic "record" can then be reproduced as it
in turn passes over a sensitive electromagnetic generator creates an electrical
signal in proportion to the magnetism present along the length of tape.

<p><b>Overtone -</b> An integer multiple of fundamental frequency. The
first overtone is twice the fundamental, the second is three times the
fundamental, etc. (WW)
<p><b>Overload -</b> 1. The type of distortion that occurs when an applied

that exists when this distortion is produced. (WW)
<p><b>Oversampling -</b> A process by which each audio sample is read from
a compact disc more than once, mainly to double-check the accuracy of the
first reading, but also to interpolate values between samples, increasing
the effective sampling rate. Oversampling rates of 88.2 kHz and 176.4 kHz
are available on higher quality players, but there is no proof that the
process improves the sound of the output, at least for the average listener.
(WW)
<p><b>Oxide -</b> The actual magnetic material applied to one side of all
recording tape. It is made of small particles of iron oxide (specifically
gamma ferric oxide) or other magnetic material stirred into and suspended

<p><b>Peak Reading Meter -</b> A level meter driven by a circuit that registers
and holds transient peaks in the signal long enough for the pointer or
display to show the highest instantaneous level in each peak. (WW)
<p><b>Phantom Power Supply - </b>A type of microphone power supply that
raises the voltage potential of both conductors in a balanced line to the
same DC value, the opposite voltage being applied to the shield. Because
both signal leads are identically charged, the input channel that receives
the mic's output cannot sense a polarizing voltage at all. Hence the name
"phantom." Many consoles have internal phantom supplies, individually assignable
to any or all mic input lines. (WW)
<p><b>Phase -</b> The time relationship of two or more sound waves reaching
the same point in space simultaneously, or of two or more signals passing
through the same point in an electronic circuit simultaneously. If the
two sounds or signals are of identical frequencies, they are "inphase"
if the peaks and troughs of the waves occur simultaneously. They are "out?
of phase" if the peaks of one partially or fully cancel the peaks of the
other. The degree of "out-of-phaseness" is designated in degrees (x&deg;)
such that 0&deg; phase difference indicates two sounds or signals exactly
"inphase," and 180&deg; phase difference indicates the two are completely
"out-of-phase," cancelling each other completely. (WW)

the axis of minimum sensitivity at l80&deg;. The pattern derives its name
from its heart-shaped appearance. (WW)
<p><b>Hyper-Cardioid</b> <b>Microphone</b> - The narrowest of unidirectional
patterns, narrower even than super-cardioid, indicating very low off-axis
sensitivity. There is usually a small lobe of sensitivity around 180&deg;.

<p><b>Pre-amplifier or Preamp - </b>In a console or other audio system,
the first stage of amplification, in which very low level input signals,
such as from a phonograph cartridge or microphone, are boosted to line
level (or some usable level). Many pre-amplifiers contain circuits to equalize
signals whose source has a known imbalance in frequency content, again
such as a phonograph record. (WW)
<p><b>Pressure Zone (PZM</b>) <b>Microphone</b> - A type of microphone
first developed and marketed by Crown Corporation, in which a dynamic or
condenser capsule is mounted flush at the surface of a rigid metal plate
or other plate several inches on a side. When the plate is taped to a wall,
the inside of a piano lid, or other rigid surface, only direct sound can
reach the capsule. This eliminates most direct/indirect phasing problems
that can be generated by virtue of mic placement itself, and (in theory)
leads to a clearer sound. Many companies now make PZM mics. (WW)
<p><b>Print-through - </b>The unwanted transfer of signal from one layer

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Read-Only Memory (ROM)- </b>A type of computer memory into which
data has been factory stored. Hence the user can only read the data. He
cannot rearrange or replace it. Used to store programs that (a) comprise
the machine's operating system, (b) translate between user languages such

any basic program the user needs in order to run applications software.
ROM cartridges and/or cards also store factory designed patches for many
synthesizers. (WW)
<p><b>Resolution - </b>1. Generally, the measure of photographic sharpness

of pixels into which a horizontal line of picture is accurately divided.
This presumes that the system in use is capable of supplying distinct picture

are always bi-directional. Other patterns can be achieved by blocking sounds
approaching the ribbon from various directions. (WW)

reproduce the croak at any desired pitch through the various keys of a
synthesizer. (WW)
<p><b>Sample and Hold Circuit - </b>Any electronic circuit that can take
a measurement of the instantaneous voltage (or other parameter) of a signal
and hold the value for processing and/or display until the next sample
is requested. The time at which the sample is taken may be manually designated,

<p><b>Shelf Equalization -</b> Any type of equalization in which the boost
or cut levels off to a constant shelf of the specified number of decibels.
A shelf equalization of +5 dB at 5 kHz implies that from 5 kHz to 20 kHz

in each position of the columns and rows of the matrix. He can also define
equational relationships between the items in various columns and rows.
By plugging in different test values for each entry, the user can predict
how various factors will affect the outcome of the overall program. He
can thus computer-optimize cost, time, and other factors in order to achieve
specific business goals. (WW)
<p><b>Stereophonic - </b>A type of audio system that uses two or more speakers

<p><b>Track Format -</b> For any tape recorder or recorded tape, the number
of tracks, their width and position with respect to the tape, and the overall
width of the tape itself. Tape speed is not always included. In general
use, some factors are left out if the remaining factors uniquely specify
a particular format. For example, "quarter track" uniquely specifies 1/4"
tape width with two pairs of stereo tracks, each pair recorded in one direction
on the tape. Similarly, 8-track 1" and 24-track uniquely specify two common
professional formats.
<p><u>The common formats for 1/4" tape are</u>:
<ul>
<li type="circle">

tape width.</li>

<li type="circle">
HalfTrack (or Two-Track), in which the tape contains two tracks of information,
which can be recorded in separate directions as mono tracks, or simultaneously
in the same direction as stereo. The professional standard for stereo master
mixes.</li>

<li type="circle">
Quarter-Track, as described above, with the pairs of stereo tracks (indicated
as 1-3 and 2-4 pairs) arranged across the tape in 1-4-3-2 order. Considered
a home reel-to-reel format.</li>
</ul>
<u>Common 1/2" tape formats are:</u>
<ul>
<li type="circle">

mixes with separate SMPTE or other synchronizing tracks.</li>

<li type="circle">
Eight-and Sixteen-Track, considered semi-pro formats, and used mainly in
making demos.</li>
</ul>
<u>The only 1" pro format</u> is Eight-Track, with Sixteen-Track available
on some machines for semipro demo applications.
<p><u>2" formats</u>, because of the expense of the tape transport needed

the incoming level of a mic or line input can be lowered. 2. (verb). To
attenuate the incoming level of a signal. For example, "Trim the mic in
module number three." (WW)
<p><b>Tweeter -</b> A loudspeaker designed to reproduce high frequencies.

<p><b>Unbalanced Line -</b> A signal line with two conductors: one that
carries the signal, the other at ground potential. The ground conductor
is often used as the shield. Unbalanced lines are more subject to the effects
of ambient magnetic or electric fields than balanced lines. (WW)

<p><b>Vibrato</b> - A wavering quality in a steady musical tone or sound,
caused by a cyclical change in its musical pitch (or fundamental frequency)�above
and below its nominal pitch. Often confused with tremolo. (WW)
<p><b>Volatile</b> - A type of computer memory which can only store data
when charged with electricity. When power is turned off, the contents of
memory are lost. (WW)
<p><b>Volt - </b>(symbol V) A unit of voltage. The voltage between two
points of a conducting wire carrying a constant current of 1 ampere, when
the power dissipated between these two points is 1 watt. (WW)
<p><b>Voltage - </b>The difference in the electrical potential of two points
in a circuit. (WW)
<p><b>Voltage-Controlled Amplifier (VCA)</b> - An amplifier whose gain
is controlled by an external voltage having nothing to do with the signal
being amplified. Used in some recording consoles for subgrouping, in automated
mixing, etc.(WW)
<p><b>Voltage-Controlled Filter (VCF) - </b>A variable bandpass filter,
the cut-off frequency of which increases or decreases in proportion to
an externally supplied DC control voltage. Used in many synthesizers to
change the timbre of the output signal. (WW)
<p><b>Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) - </b>An oscillator whose output
frequency varies in proportion to an externally supplied control voltage.
The main tone-producing circuit of many synthesizers. (WW)
<p><b>Volume</b> 1. Colloquial term for sound pressure level. 2. Short
for volume control. (WW)
<p><b>Volume</b> Unit - A unit of signal level corresponding to the ear's
subjective judgment of changes in audio program level or loudness. (WW)
<p><b>VU Meter -</b> A level meter calibrated in volume units. Most VU
meters are calibrated in decibels and % modulation, a linear scale defined
such that 100% modulation = 0 dBVU. The ballistics of a VU meter (a function
of its components and the inertia of the indicator itself) approximates
the response of the human ear to sudden level changes. The ear senses the
average level of sounds, not their momentary peaks. Similarly, the VU meter
cannot move fast enough to indicate every peak. When the meter bounces
up to 0 dBVU, the peak that caused that bounce may actually have reached
+10 dBVU or more. (WW)

<p><b>Word Length - </b>The number of bits composing each word of digital
data. The more bits in each digital audio sample, for instance, the greater
the number of quantizing increments by which the incoming analog wave can
be represented. This, in turn, affords greater accuracy in recording and
reproduction of the original waveform. (WW)
<p><b>Word Processor</b> - In computers, software that allows the computer
to accept, edit, format, and then send data to a printer for finished text
and/or graphic presentation. It enables the user to input long text programs,
to electronically shuffle various parts of the text into a satisfactory
order, then specify the format in which it will be printed, including margins,
justification, characters, and line spacing, etc. (WW)
<p><b>Woofer -</b> A loudspeaker designed to reproduce low frequencies
only. (WW)
<p><a NAME="Wow"></a><b>Wow</b> - A slow variation in the musical pitch
of recorded sounds caused by inconstant tape speed. A slower kind of <a href="#Flutter">Flutter</a>.
